Israel unilaterally withdrew the last of its troops and settlers in 2005, ending a presence inside Gaza that began in 1967, but maintained near complete control over the territory\u2019s borders. All settlements on occupied Palestinian land are regarded as illegal under international law, regardless of whether they were approved by Israel.\nUpdated at 16.00 CET\n1 Jan 2024 02.16 CET Bethan McKernan At least 100 people have been killed in Gaza in the past 24 hours, as the three-month-old conflict between Israel and Hamas rolls into the new year with no end in sight and only tentative Israeli government plans for discussing the day after the war is over. The Hamas-run territory\u2019s health authority said about 48 people were killed overnight on Sunday in heavy Israeli bombing of Gaza City, where pockets of fierce fighting are ongoing despite claims by the Israel Defense Forces that the north of the blockaded exclave is largely under Israeli operational control. Another strike killed 20 people sheltering at al-Aqsa University in the west of Gaza City, witnesses said.

A former member of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet has offered a rare public apology, Associated Press reports. The news agency says Galit Distel Atbaryan, a lawmaker from Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party, appeared to accept responsibility for the polarised atmosphere ahead of the 7 October attack. \u201cI\u2019m here sitting and telling you, the democratic, secular public: I sinned against you, I caused pain for you, I caused you to fear for your lives here, and I am sorry for this,\u201d she told Channel 13 TV. Distel Atbaryan appeared to accept the argument that the internal divisions created perceptions of weakness that encouraged Hamas to attack, AP reports. Distel Atbaryan added that she was taking responsibility for her role in the massive protests and civil discord that erupted after Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing government attempted to implement a far-reaching overhaul of the judicial system.\nUpdated at 02.04 CET\n31 Dec 2023 00.45 CET While the world marks the new year, in Gaza the war dominates everything.

In an interview with Democracy Now, Husam Zomlot said: \u201cEverybody now is wanting us to discuss the day after. No. The day before. The day before 7 October. The occupation, the colonisation, the racism, the supremacy, the murders all over the West Bank, the provocations in Jerusalem, the rounding and arresting of our children without trial, without charge, without access to their parents or lawyers, this is what needs to be discussed.\u201d\nThe Palestinian foreign minister has released a statement before the new year in which he condemned what he called the \u201cIsraeli war machine\u2019s persistence in the war of genocide\u201d. In a statement on X, Riad Malki wrote: \u201cWe welcome the new year and the 59th anniversary of the start of the Palestinian revolution, yet the wounds of our people are bleeding due to Israeli war machine\u2019s persistence in the war of genocide, destruction, and displacement.\u201d\nApproximately 1.4 million Palestinians who have been displaced by Israeli strikes are living in UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip, the UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma said. She told the BBC: \u201cThe facilities in the north are becoming crowded by the hour, people continue to come in. They are absolutely full and so people have started taking refuge in areas outside these facilities including in parks, in the open.
