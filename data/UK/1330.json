The violence also includes alleged war crimes, which rights groups say are often covered up.\nIn Mali, both the armed forces and extremist rebels have killed and abused numerous civilians in the country\u2019s central and northern regions for allegedly collaborating with either side of the conflict, Human Rights Watch said in its report. Malian security forces were responsible for at least 40 civilian deaths, nearly half of whom were children, the report said.\n\u201cThe targeted killing of civilians by Islamist armed groups and the Malian army are war crimes that should be thoroughly and impartially investigated,\u201d Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in the report based on interviews with 40 people, including more than 30 witnesses.\nHRW's findings were communicated to Mali\u2019s justice and defense ministers who never responded, the group said.\nIn Burkina Faso, where HRW had previously accused the military of war crimes, Amnesty said it found that the Ansaroul Islam extremist group and other armed groups are killing and abducting women and girls, while also disrupting key infrastructure in communities to carry out \u201cbrutal sieges.\u201d\n\u201cThey have not only enforced sieges across the country, but they have also killed thousands of civilians and destroyed civilian infrastructure, including bridges and water points,\u201d said Samira Daoud, Amnesty International\u2019s regional director for West and Central Africa.\nThe tactics to enforce the sieges have also limited residents\u2019 access to health and education, forcing one in 12 people across the country to flee their homes, the organization said.\nThe lives of millions are \u201changing in the balance\u201d because of the abuses in Burkina Faso, Amnesty said, as it called on the international community to step up efforts to ensure that \u201dthose responsible for (the) war crimes and human rights abuses are held accountable.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Rights groups report widespread war crimes across Africa\u2019s Sahel region with communities under siege", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-burkina-faso-amnesty-international-human-rights-watch-mali-b2440495.html"}
