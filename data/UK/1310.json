But there is no agreement as of yet to actually get this done,\u201d the official said on Friday. Reuters quoted a US official saying there was \u201cindirect engagement\u201d aimed at finding a way to get the hostages out but that the work was extremely difficult. It\u2019s something we\u2019re working on extremely hard. An estimated 240 Israeli and foreign hostages were kidnapped by Hamas during its 7 October assault that killed more than 1,400 people, according to Israeli officials. A US official said \u201cnobody knows\u201d the exact number of hostages, adding that it was \u201cwell over 100 and maybe over 200\u201d. To get that many people out \u201cis going to require a fairly significant pause in hostilities\u201d. But the official warned: There\u2019s absolutely no guarantee a) that is going to happen or b) when it\u2019s going to happen. Israel and the US have both previously ruled out a blanket ceasefire, which they say would allow Hamas to regroup and resupply, but US president Joe Biden has backed \u201ctemporary, localised\u201d pauses. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said there can be no \u201ctemporary truce\u201d in Gaza unless Hamas releases the hostages.\nUpdated at 02.17 CET\n4 Nov 2023 05.45 CET In case you missed it earlier: five people were arrested during a pro-Palestinian sit-in at King\u2019s Cross station in London after the demonstration was banned. The transport secretary, Mark Harper, said he had given an order to allow police to stop the demonstration on Friday evening and later announced that protesters would also be prevented from gathering outside the Israeli embassy in London over the weekend. On Friday evening scores of people could still be seen outside King\u2019s Cross station on social media. One video posted on X (formerly Twitter) appears to show a man draped in a Palestinian flag shouting \u201cfree, free Palestine\u201d while being carried away from the station by three officers.

In this clash, the battle lines are drawn in a very different place, and the alliances and enmities take unexpected shapes. We got a glimpse of it this week \u2013 and when the current violence subsides, we shall see it even more starkly. Right now, that moment \u2013 what diplomats and others refer to as \u201cthe day after\u201d \u2013 seems a long way off, though the visit to Israel on Friday of the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, suggests that Washington is already looking at its watch: proof that even some of Israel\u2019s staunchest allies are alarmed by the mounting loss of life in Gaza. It goes to the poisonous, often-overlooked dynamic that has been present in the Israel-Palestine conflict for decades, and which will matter again when the current chapter ends. For then we\u2019ll see that the contest that matters most is the battle of hardliners v moderates, or, to be more specific, maximalists v partitionists: those who insist on having the whole land for themselves v those who are ready to share it.

The Associated Press reports that Thomas White said he had travelled \u201cthe length and breadth of Gaza in the last few weeks\u201d and described the place as a \u201cscene of death and destruction\u201d. No place was safe now, he said, and people feared for their lives, their future and their ability to feed their families. The Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) was supporting about 89 bakeries across Gaza, aiming to get bread to 1.7 million people, White told diplomats from the UN\u2019s 193 member nations in a video briefing from Gaza.

UN deputy Middle East coordinator Lynn Hastings, who is also the humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, said only one of three water supply lines from Israel was operational. Many people are relying on brackish or saline ground water, if at all.\n4 Nov 2023 03.29 CET Palestinian Red Crescent condemns deadly strike on Gaza ambulance The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has condemned the targeting of a convoy of ambulances in Gaza by Israeli forces on Friday, which it says killed 15 people and wounded more than 60 others. The PRCS said in a statement early on Saturday that one of its ambulances was struck \u201cby a missile fired by the Israeli forces\u201d about two metres from the entrance to the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, Agence France-Presse reports. The attack resulted in the deaths of 15 civilians and wounded 60 other people, the PRCS said, mirroring figures released earlier by the Hamas-run health ministry. Another ambulance, belonging to the health ministry, was \u201cdirectly targeted\u201d by a missile about a kilometre from the hospital, causing injuries and damage, it said.

Photograph: Momen Al-Halabi/AFP/Getty Images The PRCS, part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, added that deliberately targeting medical teams constituted \u201ca grave violation of the Geneva Conventions, a war crime\u201d. Israel\u2019s military said it had launched an air strike on \u201can ambulance that was identified by forces as being used by a Hamas terrorist cell in close proximity to their position in the battle zone\u201d. \u201cA number of Hamas terrorist operatives were killed in the strike,\u201d a military statement said. An AFP journalist at the scene of the attack saw multiple bodies beside the damaged ambulance outside the hospital, which is overcrowded with civilians seeking shelter from Israeli bombing as well as those wounded.\nUpdated at 04.03 CET\n4 Nov 2023 03.06 CET Blinken in Jordan to meet King Abdullah US secretary of state Antony Blinken is to meet Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II on Saturday after leaving Israel empty-handed in his efforts to secure humanitarian pauses in its war to destroy Hamas, Agence France-Presse reports. Blinken arrived late on Friday in Amman, where he will also join a meeting of foreign ministers of five Arab countries which will be attended by a representative of the Palestinian Authority (PA) led by president Mahmud Abbas, a rival of Hamas. In Israel, Blinken discussed with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu the idea of \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas and to allow aid to be distributed to the Gaza Strip population. But after meeting Blinken on Friday, Netanyahu said there could be no \u201ctemporary truce\u201d in Gaza unless Hamas released the hostages it held.

Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters\nUpdated at 04.03 CET\n4 Nov 2023 02.44 CET The day after an explosion that seriously damaged Agence France-Presse\u2019s office in Gaza, the Israeli army claimed on Friday that it carried out a strike \u201cnearby\u201d to the news agency\u2019s bureau without having \u201cin any way\u201d targeted it, the agency reports. AFP is the only one of the world\u2019s three major international news agencies currently operating a live video feed from Gaza City which has not been interrupted despite the damage, seen by an AFP employee on Friday. The unmanned AFP camera broadcasting live 24/7 captured the moment of the strike, a few minutes before midday (1000 GMT) on Thursday. An AFP employee who visited the office on Friday said an explosive projectile appeared to have entered the technician\u2019s office in the bureau horizontally from east to west. The strike destroyed the wall opposite the window and caused significant damage to the adjacent room and other doors. It also punctured water tanks on the roof. An Israeli military spokesman initially said it had \u201cchecked [the report] multiple times\u201d. \u201cThere was no IDF [Israel Defense Forces] strike on the building\u201d in Gaza, he told AFP. Following further questioning by AFP, the army said it had carried out a strike near the building.\n4 Nov 2023 02.03 CET 'Significant' pause in fighting discussed to secure hostages' release, says US Talks are being held on a \u201cvery significant\u201d pause in the Israel-Hamas war to win the release of hostages taken Hamas, Agence France-Presse is quoting a senior US official as saying. \u201cIt is something that is under a very serious and active discussion.

Another video showed three ambulances standing in a line, with about a dozen people lying either motionless or barely moving next to them, the news agency reports. Blood was pooled nearby. As we\u2019ve reported, the World Health Organisation director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a social media post he was \u201cutterly shocked by reports of attacks on ambulances evacuating patients\u201d, adding that patients, health workers and medical facilities must be protected. Israel\u2019s military has said it hit an ambulance \u201cbeing used by a Hamas terrorist cell\u201d and that Hamas fighters were killed in the northern Gaza strike. Hamas said its fighters were not present. Israel\u2019s military said in a statement: \u201cWe emphasise that this area is a battle zone. Civilians in the area are repeatedly called upon to evacuate southwards for their own safety.\u201d Earlier on Friday, Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesperson for Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry, said ambulances would send critically injured Palestinians who urgently needed to be taken to Egypt to be treated from besieged Gaza City to the south of the territory.\nUpdated at 01.43 CET\n4 Nov 2023 01.23 CET Fifteen killed in Israeli strike on Gaza ambulance, says Gazan ministry The Israeli air strike on an ambulance being used to evacuate the wounded from besieged northern Gaza on Friday killed 15 and injured 60, the Hamas-controlled territory\u2019s health ministry said. Reuters reports Israel\u2019s military said it had identified and hit an ambulance \u201cbeing used by a Hamas terrorist cell\u201d. It said Hamas fighters were killed in the strike, and accused the group of transferring militants and weapons in ambulances. Hamas official Izzat El Reshiq said allegations its fighters were present were \u201cbaseless\u201d. Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesperson for Gaza\u2019s health ministry, said the ambulance was part of a convoy that Israel targeted near Gaza City\u2019s al-Shifa Hospital. Qidra said Israel had targeted the convoy of ambulances in more than one location, including at al-Shifa Hospital gate and at Ansar Square a kilometre (0.6 miles) away. In a statement on the incident, Israel\u2019s military gave no evidence to support its assertion that the ambulance was linked to Hamas but said it intended to release additional information.

It\u2019s just passed 2.20am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv\nUpdated at 01.27 CET\n3 Nov 2023 00.48 CET The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PCRS) has accused Israeli forces of targeting a convoy of ambulances which it said was transporting injured Palestinians towards the Rafah border crossing into Egypt. In a statement, the PCRS \u2013 which is part of the International Red Cross \u2013 said a convoy of five ambulances departed from al-Shifa hospital at approximately 4pm on Friday towards the southern area of the Gaza Strip. The ambulances then had to turn back towards the hospital, after finding the road blocked by rubble and rocks from shelling, it said. During the return, at a distance of not more that 1 KM away from Al-Shifa hospital, the leading ambulance (belonging to [Ministry of Health]) in the convoy was directly targeted by a missile, resulting in its immediate and direct damage, as well as injuring its crew and the injured inside. The statement said the other ambulances \u2013 one of which belonged to the PCRS \u2013 continued towards al-Shifa hospital. It said that its ambulance was struck by a missile fired by Israeli forces \u201conly at a distance of about two meters\u201d from the gate of al-Shifa hospital. It said the ambulance was carrying an injured 35-year-old who was destined to receive medical treatment in an Egyptian hospital. The strike resulted in the deaths of 15 civilians and more than 60 were wounded, the PCRS said. It added that a medic sustained minor shrapnel injuries to the leg and bruises, and that the ambulance driver suffered chest bruises and \u201cextreme panic\u201d. \ud83d\udd34 PRCS Statement on The Israeli Occupation Forces shelling of the Ambulance Convoy transporting the injured from the aggression on #Gaza towards Rafah crossing border on November 3rd 2023. pic.twitter.com/pzVEMeOo23 \u2014 PRCS (@PalestineRCS) November 3, 2023\n3 Nov 2023 00.32 CET US flying unarmed drones over Gaza in search of hostages The US has confirmed for the first time that it has been flying unarmed surveillance drones over Gaza. In a statement on Friday, Pentagon spokesperson Brig Gen Pat Ryder said: In support of hostage recovery efforts, the US is conducting unarmed UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] flights over Gaza, as well as providing advice and assistance to support our Israeli partner as they work on their hostage recovery efforts. The US began flying UAV flights after the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel, he added.\n3 Nov 2023 00.28 CET Honduras has recalled its ambassador to Israel for consultations on what it described as the \u201cserious humanitarian situation\u201d facing Palestinians in Gaza. Honduras\u2019s foreign minister, Enrique Rein, posted to social media: Amid the serious humanitarian situation the Palestinian civilian population suffers in the Gaza Strip, the government \u2026 has decided to immediately call Mr. Roberto Martinez, Ambassador of the Republic of Honduras in Israel, to consultations in Tegucigalpa. Ante la grave situaci\u00f3n humanitaria que sufre la poblaci\u00f3n civil palestina en la franja de Gaza, \u00e9l Gobierno de la Presidenta @XiomaraCastroZ ha decidido llamar inmediatamente a consultas a Tegucigalpa al Se\u00f1or Roberto Martinez, Embajador de la Rep\u00fablica de Honduras en Israel. \u2014 Enrique Reina (@EnriqueReinaHN) November 3, 2023 The decision follows similar moves from other Latin American countries to register diplomatic protests against Israel in response to its latest conflict with Hamas. Bolivia\u2019s leftwing government earlier this week announced that it was cutting ties entirely and attributing its decision to alleged war crimes and human rights abuses being committed in the Gaza Strip. Hours later, the governments of Chile and Colombia recalled their ambassadors from Israel, while Brazil\u2019s president criticised the continued airstrikes on Gaza.\nUpdated at 00.35 CET", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "UN says agency in Gaza \u2018practically out of business\u2019 - as it happened", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/03/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-un-blinken-expected-call-for-pauses-fighting-allow-aid-gaza-tel-aviv-visit"}
