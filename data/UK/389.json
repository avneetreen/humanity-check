He provided a partial list of the names of those killed \u2014 16 heads of households from the al-Mughrabi family \u2014 and said the dead included women and children.\nAmong the dead were Issam al-Mughrabi, a veteran employee of U.N. Development Program, his wife, and their five children.\n\u201cThe loss of Issam and his family has deeply affected us all. The U.N. and civilians in Gaza are not a target,\u201d said Achim Steiner, the head of the agency. \u201cThis war must end.\u201d\nIsrael declared war after Hamas militants stormed across the border on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking some 240 hostages. Israel has vowed to keep up the fight until Hamas is destroyed and removed from power in Gaza and all the hostages are freed.\nMore than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's war to destroy Hamas and more than 53,000 have been wounded, according to health officials in Gaza, a besieged territory ruled by the Islamic militant group for the past 16 years.\nIsrael blames Hamas for the high civilian death toll, citing the group\u2019s use of crowded residential areas for military purposes and its tunnels under urban areas. It has unleashed thousands of airstrikes since Oct. 7, and has largely refrained from commenting on specific attacks, including discussing the intended target.\nOn Friday, the U.N. Security Council adopted a watered-down resolution that calls for immediately speeding up aid deliveries to desperate civilians in Gaza.\nThe United States won the removal of a tougher call for an \u201curgent suspension of hostilities\u201d between Israel and Hamas. It abstained in the vote, as did Russia, which wanted the stronger language. The resolution was the first on the war to make it through the council after the U.S. vetoed two earlier ones calling for humanitarian pauses and a full cease-fire.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated his longstanding call for a humanitarian cease-fire. He expressed hope that Friday\u2019s resolution may help this happen but said \u201cmuch more is needed immediately\u201d to end the ongoing \u201cnightmare\u201d for the people in Gaza.\nHe told a news conference that it's a mistake to measure the effectiveness of the humanitarian operation in Gaza by the number of trucks.\n\u201cThe real problem is that the way Israel is conducting this offensive is creating massive obstacles to the distribution of humanitarian aid inside Gaza,\u201d he said. He said the prerequisites for an effective aid operation don\u2019t exist \u2014 security, staff that can work in safety, logistical capacity especially trucks, and the resumption of commercial activity.\nIsrael\u2019s aerial and ground offensive has been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history, displacing nearly 85% of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people and leveling wide swaths of the tiny coastal enclave. More than half a million people in Gaza \u2014 a quarter of the population \u2014 are starving, according to a report this week from the United Nations and other agencies.\nShielded by the Biden administration, Israel has so far resisted international pressure to scale back. The military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said late Friday that forces are widening the ground offensive \u201cto additional areas of the strip, with a focus on the south.\u201d He said operations were also continuing in the northern half of Gaza, including Gaza City, the initial focus of Israel's ground offensive.\nThe army said Saturday that it carried out airstrikes against Hamas fighters in several locations of Gaza City. The military says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, including about 2,000 in the past three weeks, but it has not presented any evidence to back up the claim. It says 139 of its soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive.\nIn the aftermath of the U.N. resolution, it was not immediately clear how and when aid deliveries would accelerate. Currently, trucks enter through two crossings \u2014 Rafah on the border with Egypt and Kerem Shalom on the border with Israel.\nAs part of the approved resolution, the U.S. negotiated the removal of language that would have given the U.N. authority to inspect aid going into Gaza, something Israel says it must continue to do to ensure material does not reach Hamas.\nIsrael\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdan, thanked the U.S. for its support and sharply criticized the U.N. for its failure to condemn Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attacks. The U.S. vetoed a resolution in October that would have included a condemnation because it didn\u2019t also underline Israel\u2019s right to self-defense.\nHamas said in a statement that the U.N. resolution should have demanded an immediate halt to Israel\u2019s offensive, and it blamed the United States for pushing \u201cto empty the resolution of its essence\u201d before Friday\u2019s Security Council vote.\n___\nMagdy reported from Cairo.
