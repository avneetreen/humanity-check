Mark Milley who exited the military in October and Gen. James McConville who served as the 40th chief of staff of the Army until 2023.\n'These individuals enabled lawlessness and the unwilling experimentation on service members,' they state.\n'The moral and physical injuries they helped inflict are significant. They betrayed the trust of service members and the American people. Their actions caused irreparable harm to the Armed Forces and the institutions for which we have fought and bled.'\nThey have 'refused to resign' or take any accountability for their actions, the service members state.\nThe letter goes on to mutually pledge to hold them to account through 'lawful word and action.'\nIt is signed by a handful of candidates who are running for Congress in 2024 including Mara Macie, a military spouse in Florida, and Cameron Hamilton in Virginia, a former Navy SEAL.\nThe Army recently was under scrutiny for attempting to win back favor with soldiers who were fired after declining the COVID-19 vaccine for religious or medical reasons, offering a 'correction of military records.'\nBut the letter sparked an outcry of fury at the Defense Department by lawmakers and current and former service members who said there was always a process in place to do just that.\nSince the mandate, Army has also faced a huge shortage of recruits in fiscal year 2022 at 55,000 - which was 10,000 short of its target for the year.\nCongress is also working to further remedy the wrongs that these service members faced, but many soldiers have told DailyMail.com that it is just the start.\nIn the most recent National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which passed a year later in December 2023, there is a provision allowing former service members who were fired to change their discharge status.\nBut some current and former troops are saying that the amendments in the FY 2024 NDAA are not strong enough to undo the 'serious harassment' they endured over the last two years.\nAt 4am EST today (a few min ago), senior military leaders received an email with a letter attached called the Declaration of Military Accountability. I know because I sent the email. I sent it on behalf of myself & 230 other signatories of the letter.
