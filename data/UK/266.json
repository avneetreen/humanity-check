Photograph: Alaa Al-Marjani/Reuters\nThe Israeli army also claimed to have killed a Hamas commander in Syria, whom it described as a \u201ccentral figure\u201d in the launching Hamas rocket attacks against Israel.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Hassan Akasha had been \u201celiminated\u201d in Beit Jinn, a Syrian-controlled area close to the Golan Heights, which have been annexed by Israel.\nThe health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said it had recorded 249 deaths in the previous 24 hours, dozens of whom arrived along with 99 wounded at al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza. More than 23,000, mostly women and children, have now died in the territory since the war began, according to local officials.\nJordan\u2019s King Abdullah, speaking in Rwanda, said on Monday that Israel had created a whole generation of orphans with its \u201cbrutal\u201d war in Gaza, where he said more than 30,000 people, mostly women and children, had been killed or were missing as a result of the conflict.\n\u201cMore children have died in Gaza than in all other conflicts around the world this past year. Of those who have survived, many have lost one or both parents, an entire generation of orphans \u2026 how can indiscriminate aggression and shelling bring peace? How can they guarantee security, when they are building on hatred?\u201d he said.\nAnalysts say regional powers are essential to any postwar scenario for Gaza\u2019s governance.\nSanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and north Africa programme at Chatham House in London, said urgent planning was needed to avoid a long-lasting simmering conflict that would be the most dangerous and least desirable outcome for the Israelis and their security, the Palestinians and the region.\n\u201cThe region needs to have a plan, one that will endure. Currently it is a game of hot potato with everyone saying what they won\u2019t do. It is a really time-sensitive moment and there needs to be real immediate planning,\u201d Vakil said.\nDaniel Levy, an analyst and president of the US/Middle East Project, said US efforts to influence Netanyahu had been broadly ineffectual so far.\n\u201cI think very early on Netanyahu felt he had the Americans where he wanted them and he hasn\u2019t looked back since, and the Americans haven\u2019t given him a reason to look back either,\u201d Levy said.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean there hasn\u2019t been a bit of light turbulence \u2026 but the Americans have not been willing to do what it takes to move the dial at all.\u201d\nIsraeli officials have scrambled to head off mounting frustration in Washington ahead of Blinken\u2019s visit by signalling concessions including a shift to military tactics using fewer ground troops or airstrikes, and offering some policy proposals on Gaza.\nPlans outlined by Israeli officials differ starkly from US calls for a revitalised Palestinian Authority, which is based in the occupied West Bank, to take control of Gaza and a start negotiations towards creating a Palestinian state alongside Israel.\nBlinken has sought to reassure Arab officials that the US opposes the displacement of Palestinians outside Gaza, and instead wants Israel\u2019s Muslim majority neighbours to play a role in the territory\u2019s future governance.\nAmid fears that the bloody ongoing conflict risks destabilising the volatile region, the US is asking regional states to reduce tensions. Recent weeks have seen surging violence in the occupied West Bank, Syria and Iraq, and Houthi attacks from Yemen on Red Sea shipping lanes.\nView image in fullscreen Smoke rises in the Gaza Strip during an Israeli military operation.

This is a conflict that could easily metastasise, causing even more insecurity and even more suffering,\u201d Blinken told a news conference in Doha alongside Qatar\u2019s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, on Sunday night.\nConflict has also flared across the disputed border between Lebanon and Israel, with clashes between the IDF and Hezbollah escalating since October.\nLast week Israel assassinated a senior Hamas official in a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut, causing a new round of more intense exchanges. A key surveillance complex was damaged by anti-tank missiles fired by Hezbollah on Saturday.\nAfter an Israeli airstrike killed an elite Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon on Monday, Hezbollah identified the slain fighter as Wissam al-Tawil without providing details, the most senior militant in the armed group to have been killed.\nLebanese security sources described Tawil as having played a key role in leading the elite Radwan forces in southern Lebanon.\nUnderlining his seniority, Hezbollah circulated pictures of Tawil with Hezbollah leaders and the late leader of the Iranian Quds force, Qassem Suleimani, who was killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad four years ago.\nA Lebanese security source, quoted by Reuters, described Tawil\u2019s death as \u201ca very painful strike\u201d while another suggested his killing would inevitably lead to more escalation.\nEylon Levy, an Israeli government spokesperson, said Israel did not want a war with Hezbollah but would force the militant organisation to withdraw elite fighters from the disputed border if necessary.\n\u201cWe are now at a fork in the road: either Hezbollah backs off or we will push it away,\u201d Levy told reporters.\nUN experts on Monday described \u201ca growing body of evidence\u201d of sexual violence against Israeli civilians during the 7 October attacks as \u201charrowing\u201d. Hamas denies the abuses.\nThe UN also voiced alarm at the many journalists killed in the war in Gaza, a day after two Al Jazeera reporters died in an Israeli strike on their car in what the network called a \u201ctargeted killing\u201d.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Antony Blinken arrives in Israel amid fresh US push to stop war spreading", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/08/antony-blinken-arrives-in-israel-amid-fresh-us-push-to-stop-war-spreading"}
