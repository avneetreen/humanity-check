Its army has expressed regret for civilian deaths, accusing Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields \u2013 a charge the group denies.\nThe speed and intensity of the killings is \u201crecord-breaking\u201d, said James Denslow from Save the Children, adding that the charity had estimated more than 30,000 children have been killed or maimed over the past 12 weeks.\nThey based their calculations on a combination of Gaza ministry of health numbers and UN figures, plus other reports of casualties and those missing on the ground.\n\u201cThis is the highest number of children killed and maimed in one conflict since 2006 when United Nations records began,\u201d Mr Denslow told The Independent.\n\u201cThis is also 21 times higher than the number of children killed and maimed in Ukraine last year,\u201d he added.\nThe UN has verified that 131,311 children have been killed or maimed across conflict situations since 2006. These numbers \u2013 which go up to 2022 \u2013 are woefully low estimates, particularly in countries such as Syria, where rights groups say accessing the death toll is near impossible.\n\u201cBut even if we go by the caveated numbers in Gaza, in just over two months they are already a quarter of a way through that total number of children killed and maimed in 17 years,\u201d said Mr Denslow. \u201cFor the intensity, it is something I have never seen before.\u201d\nPalestinian children wait to receive food cooked by a charity kitchen in Rafah (Reuters)\nJan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said that aside from the besieged areas of Syria during the worst days of 2015, the \u201cscale of the killing of civilians has not been seen in a generation\u201d.\nHe said such a child death toll had not likely been recorded since the genocide in Rwanda 30 years ago.\n\u201cIn an ocean of human misery and in a world that seems to be falling apart, Gaza stands out,\u201d he added.\nAn Israeli military spokesperson said: \u201cThe IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is committed to mitigating civilian harm during operational activity. In that spirit, the IDF makes great efforts to estimate and consider potential civilian collateral damage in its strikes... IDF military lawyers are on hand at all levels of command to ensure that strikes comply with international legal obligations, including proportionality.\u201d\nMore than 2.3 million people \u2013 half of them children \u2013 live in Gaza, a tiny 42km strip that even before the war was subject to a crippling 15-year siege by both Israel and Egypt.\nThe UN has repeatedly begged for a ceasefire saying there are no safe areas within the strip and no way to get out for civilians who have been displaced multiple times since October and are running out of food, water and medical supplies.\nDespite international pleas to wind down the attack, including from its ally the US, Israel has only escalated its ground offensive in Gaza in the closing days of the year.\nYoung children arrive at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis after being injured in Israeli airstrikes (Getty Images)\nThis week, Israeli tanks thrust deep into central Gaza after days of relentless bombardment that forced tens of thousands of already displaced Palestinian families to flee to the overwhelmed city of Deir al-Balah along the Mediterranean coast.\n\u201cOver 150,000 people \u2013 young children, women carrying babies, people with disabilities and the elderly \u2013 have nowhere to go,\u201d the main UN organisation operating in Gaza, UNRWA, said in a social media post.\nGaza\u2019s health ministry said on Thursday the humanitarian and health conditions of the now 1.9 million displaced people have reached \u201ccatastrophic levels beyond description\u201d.\nHalf of the displaced are children who are now struggling with dehydration, malnutrition, respiratory and skin diseases and extreme cold, the statement added. Some 50,000 pregnant women, meanwhile, are suffering from thirst and malnutrition.\nAmid growing alarm, the UN Security Council last week adopted a resolution to boost humanitarian aid but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire after a week of vote delays and intense negotiations to avoid a United States veto.\nThe US and Israel oppose a ceasefire, believing it would only benefit Hamas. Washington instead supports pauses in fighting to protect civilians and free hostages taken by Hamas.\nPalestinian children sit by the fire next to the rubble of a house in Khan Younis (Reuters)\nRights groups say without a proper ceasefire it is impossible to tend to the needs of the civilians under such conditions.\n\u201cThere are around 300,000 destroyed or damaged housing units. It is impossible to provide emergency shelters and do repairs for more than 1.2 million people,\u201d Mr Egeland said.\nIsrael has defended its actions, saying it has identified a \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d for civilians in an area called Mawasi \u2013 which is smaller than London\u2019s Heathrow airport.\n\u201cMawasi is a \u2018moonscape\u2019,\u201d Mr Egeland continued. \u201cYou can't put 1.5 million people on the moon without water, without shelter, without toilets.\u201d\nMr Denslow said this deadly combination of the geography of Gaza, the density of demographics, the percentage of children, the use of explosive weapons with a wide area affected, and the ferocity of the hostilities had led to the record-breaking casualty toll.\n\u201cChildren are unable to get away from the front line. There are no safe places. And the death toll is just the top of the pyramid of harm,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBelow that are serious life-changing injuries, [and] then the fact that people are homeless.\n\u201cBelow is the mental health impact this will have. Four out of five children in Gaza were already showing signs of depression before the war, which is the fifth conflict any 15-year-old in Gaza would have experienced.\n\u201cTheir resilience levels have been shot to pieces by recent history that has no endgame in sight.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Israel-Gaza war: Israeli bombing is killing and maiming children at a record pace, warn human rights groups", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-gaza-war-death-toll-children-b2470815.html"}
