Qassem Soleimani.\nLast month, Iran accused Israel of killing a high-ranking Iranian general, Seyed Razi Mousavi, in an airstrike on a Damascus neighborhood.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Iranian airstrikes rock US consulate in Iraqi city of Erbil as terrifying footage shows four ballistic missiles exploding on nearby compound it claims is Israeli 'spy HQ': Four civilians are killed", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12967827/erbil-airstrikes-iran-mossad-islamic-state.html"}
