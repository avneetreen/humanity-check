That ratio declined to 33% in a bombing campaign earlier this year, called Operation Shield and Arrow.\nIn the first three weeks of the current operation, Swords of Iron, the civilian proportion of total deaths rose to 61%, in what Levy described as \u201cunprecedented killing\u201d for Israeli forces in Gaza. The ratio is significantly higher than the average civilian toll in all the conflicts around the world from the second world war to the 1990s, in which civilians accounted for about half the dead, according to Levy.\n\u201cThe broad conclusion is that extensive killing of civilians not only contributes nothing to Israel\u2019s security, but that it also contains the foundations for further undermining it,\u201d Levy concluded. \u201cThe Gazans who will emerge from the ruins of their homes and the loss of their families will seek revenge that no security arrangements will be able to withstand.\u201d\nThe study confirms an investigation 10 days ago by the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, which found Israel was deliberately targeting residential blocks to cause mass civilian casualties in the hope people would turn on their Hamas rulers. The figures will make uneasy reading for the Biden administration, which is facing global criticism and isolation for vetoing a UN security council vote for a ceasefire on Friday.\nSince the start of the war, triggered by the deadly 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas, the US has been seeking to persuade Israeli forces to be more discriminating in choosing targets, and has repeatedly claimed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are \u201creceptive\u201d to US advice, despite the consistently high civilian death toll.\nThe US national security spokesperson, John Kirby, repeated that claim while briefing reporters on Air Force One on Friday, but added: \u201cWe certainly all recognise more can be done to try to reduce civilian casualties, and we\u2019re going to keep working with our Israeli counterparts to that end.\u201d\nKirby was speaking as the Biden administration faced allegations of abetting war crimes for vetoing the security council resolution.\nHuman Rights Watch said the US risked \u201ccomplicity in war crimes\u201d by continuing to provide Israel with weapons and diplomatic support. Paul O\u2019Brien, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, said: \u201cWith this veto, the US government is shamefully turning its back on immense civilian suffering, a staggering death toll, and unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.\u201d\nThe Saudi foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, met the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in Washington on Friday night to maintain pressure for \u201curgent steps\u201d to establish a ceasefire so humanitarian aid could be delivered.\nIn the face of global criticism, US officials stressed the role the US has played in pushing for humanitarian deliveries to Gaza through the Rafah crossing point. Kirby said a US military transport plane had landed in Egypt on Friday carrying nearly 26,000kg (57,000lbs) of food, water, and medicine bound for Gaza.\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly mindful of the suffering of the people of Gaza, and we\u2019re doing everything we can to not just get stuff in there but to lead an actual international effort to get stuff in there,\u201d he said.\nKirby said fewer than 100 trucks had crossed through the Rafah gate on Friday, about half the daily volume that entered Gaza during a week-long humanitarian ceasefire at the end of last month.\n\u201cObviously that\u2019s not at the level that we want it to be at,\u201d he said, noting that Israel was preparing to open an additional inspection facility at Kerem Shalom on the Israel-Gaza border, which is expected to ease the most significant bottleneck, inspection capacity.\nHowever, the UN and other aid agencies say that even when trucks enter the Gaza Strip at Rafah, the ground offensive in southern Gaza and the general lack of security is preventing the supplies from being distributed, at a time of a high and rising threat of starvation and disease.\nThe IDF said it had failed in a hostage rescue attempt on Friday. The chief spokesperson, R Adm Daniel Hagari, said: \u201cThe forces raided a Hamas site and eliminated terrorists who had taken part in the abduction and captivity of hostages.\u201d\nHe said two Israeli soldiers had been seriously wounded in the mission, and no hostages had been rescued. He did not confirm Hamas claims that one hostage, 25-year-old Sahar Baruch, had been killed in the rescue attempt, but his home kibbutz at Be\u2019eri announced Baruch had died.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Civilians make up 61% of Gaza deaths from airstrikes, Israeli study finds", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/09/civilian-toll-israeli-airstrikes-gaza-unprecedented-killing-study"}
