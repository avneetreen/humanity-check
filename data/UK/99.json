She told the Columbia Spectator thatshe had sought medical attention at an urgent care clinic, where doctors diagnosed her with with \u201cexposure to a harmful chemical\u201d.\nstill gathering evidence, does anyone have info about these individuals? I know the campus z*onists & I\u2019ve never seen them before.\nThey didn\u2019t want to be photographed but kept confronting ppl. were wearing fake keffiyehs but took them off. Smell came from behind guy in orange. https://t.co/wHcODyQHiY pic.twitter.com/Lz2sX37IrI \u2014 Layla \ud83e\udeac (@itslaylas) January 20, 2024\nShe has since been trying to identify the two men who allegedly sprayed the chemical agent.\nA protest group known as Jews for Ceasefire were also targeted in the incident, according to witnesses.\nColumbia University interim provost Dennis Mitchell said in a statement the incident was \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and the alleged perpetrators had been identified and banned from campus.\n\u201cWe continue to urge those who have relevant information \u2014 including pictures, videos, and clothing \u2014 to share that with the Department of Public Safety and NYPD. We are grateful to the members of our community who have done so already,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms any threats or acts of violence directed toward anyone in our community. The University is committed to taking urgent action,\u201d Mr Mitchell wrote.\nThe protest had not been sanctioned by the university, which revised its event policies in November in the wake of campus protests sparked by the Israel-Hamas conflict.\nThe university suspended Students for Justice in Palestine and the local chapter of the Jewish Voice for Peace group on 10 November for repeatedly violating the policies.\nIn a joint statement, the two student groups said eight students had been hospitalised and dozens more had sought medical attention.\nPalestinian supporters gather for a protest at Columbia University, on 12 October 2023, (file photo) (AP)\nThe groups also called on Columbia to do more to protect pro-Palestinian voices on campus.\n\u201cThis hateful assault came after months of Columbia viciously targeting and repressing Palestinian student advocacy, contributing to a hostile environment that dangerously emboldens violent attacks like these during a time when violent hate crimes against Palestinian, Arab and Muslim Americans are surging,\u201d the statement read.\n\u201cThe administration must repair the damage it has done.\u201d\nIn a statement, the NYPD said a 24-year-old woman who attended the demonstration filed an assault complaint on Saturday after she \u201cbegan to feel nauseated and experienced a burning sensation in her eyes\u201d.\nFive more reports of assault were filed on Sunday, the NYPD said. No arrests have been made.\nAccording to a BBC report, skunk spray has been used by the IDF since 2008 against Palestinian protesters. The chemical has been described as \u201cworse than raw sewage\u201d.\nMistral Security, a company that supplies skunk spray in the United States for crowd control, describes it as a \u201cwater based, 100 per cent non-lethal vile smelling liquid\u201d.\nAnti-Muslim and anti-semitic hate crimes have surged across the United States since the 7 October terror attacks, when Hamas militants killed more than 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage in Israel.\nSince then, more than 25,000 Palestinians have been killed by the IDF, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "\u2018Chemical attack\u2019 on pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia possible hate crime, university says", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/columbia-palestine-chemical-attack-b2484074.html"}
