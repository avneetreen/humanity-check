But at the same time, there are some 2,000 U.S. forces stationed in Iraq under an agreement with Baghdad, mainly to counter the extremist Islamic State group.\nBaghdad also relies heavily on Washington\u2019s sanctions waivers to buy electricity from Iran, and since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iraq\u2019s foreign currency reserves have been housed at the U.S. Federal Reserve, giving the Americans significant control over Iraq\u2019s supply of dollars.\nAl-Sudani\u2019s predecessors also had to walk a delicate line between Tehran and Washington, but the Israel-Hamas war has considerably upped the stakes.\nSince the onset of the war on Oct. 7, at least 84 attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria have been claimed by an umbrella group of Iran-backed Iraqi militants dubbed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. The militants say their attacks are in retaliation for Washington\u2019s backing of Israel and its military presence in Iraq and Syria.\nAl-Sudani has condemned the attacks and U.S. counter-strikes as a violation of his country\u2019s sovereignty. He also ordered authorities to pursue militants involved in the attacks, most of which did not cause injuries or major damage. His office declined further comment.\nWashington has sent messages that its patience is wearing thin.\nAfter the embassy attack, the Pentagon said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin \u201cmade clear (to al-Sudani) that attacks against U.S. forces must stop.\u201d\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told al-Sudani that Washington expects Iraqi officials to take more action to prevent such attacks, and believes they have the capability to do so, a U.S. official told The Associated Press.\nDuring a recent trip to the region, CIA Director William Burns warned al-Sudani of \u201charsh consequences\u201d if Iraq does not act to stop the attacks, an Iraqi official said.\nThe two officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with briefing regulations.\nIn a call with the Iraqi premier earlier this month, Blinken said that the Americans would take matters into their own hands, arguing that Baghdad had not done enough to pursue the perpetrators, according to two Iraqi officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\nTwo days later, a U.S. strike on a drone launch site near the Iraqi city of Kirkuk killed five militants.\nThe U.S. and much of the international community have scrambled to prevent the war in the besieged Gaza Strip from expanding across the region.\nAnalyst Renad Mansour said he believes Iran is making sure the attacks remain below a threshold that would provoke a major U.S. response.\n\u201cBoth Iran and Iraq have maintained thus far a clear line that, at the moment, Iraq cannot turn into a playground that could destabilize the Sudani government,\u201d said Mansour, a senior research fellow at the Chatham House think tank.\nHe said that's partially due to Iraq's role of passing messages between Washington and Tehran.\nSometimes the messenger is al-Sudani.\nIn early November, Blinken met with al-Sudani in Baghdad a day before the Iraqi prime minister was set to visit Tehran. Al-Sudani had won a specific promise from the militias that no attacks would be launched during Blinken's visit, according to an Iraqi official and a member of the Kataib Hezbollah militia. Following the visit, al-Sudani carried a message from Blinken to Iran to restrain the militias.\nBoth officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\nA week after the Iraqi premier's diplomatic efforts, the United States extended Iraq\u2019s sanctions waiver by four months to purchase Iranian electricity. Iran-hawks in Washington criticized the move, saying it would shore up revenue for Tehran while its proxies are at war with Israel.\nMansour says the U.S. has used the sanctions waiver as \u201cone of its cards\u201d in economy-centered efforts to pressure Iran and Iraq.\nUnlike Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah group, seen as Iran's most powerful proxy in the region, Iraq\u2019s militias have so far only played a limited role in the conflict.\nFor now, only small number of militiamen from Iraq are in southern Lebanon, near Israel's northern border, said the official from the Kataib Hezbollah group. He said the Iraqis are working on \u201cbattle management\u201d alongside Hezbollah and representatives of Hamas, the militant group that has ruled Gaza for 16 years and is currently battling Israel.\nHe said the Iran-backed groups in Iraq do not want the conflict to spread across the region, but are prepared to respond with force to any attacks.\nShould Iran and allies choose to escalate, al-Sudani\u2019s government will likely be unable to rein them in or prevent consequences on Iraqi soil, said Iyad al-Anbar, a political science professor at Baghdad University.\n\u201cAnd this is why all al-Sudani has been able to do is try to bring some calm through statements,\u201d said al-Anbar.\n\u2014-\nChehayeb reported from Beirut.
