Joe Amoroso quizzed his students in SS202, American Politics, about civilian leadership of the military, the trust between the armed forces and the public, and how the military must not become a partisan tool.\nThere was one answer, he said, that would always be acceptable in his class filled with second-year students at the U.S. Military Academy. Hesitantly, one cadet offered a response: \u201cThe Constitution.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Amoroso said emphatically.\nHis message to the students, known as yearlings, was simple: Their loyalty is \u201cnot about particular candidates. It\u2019s not a particular person or personality that occupies these positions. It\u2019s about the Constitution.\u201d\nThe emphasis for the next generation of military officers that their loyalty must be focused on the nation\u2019s democratic underpinnings rather than on any individual is a reflection of how the armed forces are being forced to deal with America's deep political polarization at a time when trust in traditional institutions is eroding.\nThe role of the military in particular has come under scrutiny as former President Donald Trump runs to reclaim the White House and has laid out an aggressive agenda should he win. It includes potentially using the military in ways other presidents have not. That could mean invoking the Insurrection Act to send units to the border or patrol the streets of predominantly Democratic cities.\nTrump's rhetoric about top commanders also has raised concerns. While in office, Trump once referred to the military leaders in his administration as \u201cmy generals.\u201d Earlier this year, he suggested that a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired Army Gen. Mark Milley, be put to death for treason.\nPresident Joe Biden, in his first campaign address of the year, warned about Trump's rhetoric on the military and its leadership.\nWith cadets and midshipmen drawn from across the United States, students at West Point and other service academies are aware of the national mood and the potential for political divisions to seep into the military.\nThey encounter an array of classes on the Constitution and, in some cases, the history of the civilian-military relationship. Each graduate who is commissioned takes multiple oaths at school and during their service. Milley emphasized the significance of the oaths in his retirement address last fall, appearing to take aim at Trump.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take an oath to a king or a queen or to a tyrant or a dictator. And we don\u2019t take an oath to a wannabe dictator,\u201d he said.\nAt the Air Force Academy, the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol was a top subject of discussion in the Civil-Military Relations class when junior and senior-year cadets began the spring semester the next day.\nThe coincidental timing \u201cbrought introspection about their oath as future officers,\u201d said the instructor, Marybeth Ulrich. One result was a cadet-driven initiative, the Oath Project.\n\u201cInstigation of potential uprising or any issues on Capitol Hill creates immediate concern for the military and for the larger public as a whole. So we were very aware of the events as they were unfolding,\u201d said 1st Lt. Darrell Miller, now stationed with the Space Force at Buckley Space Force Base near Denver, and one of the 13 students in the class who started the project.\nDozens of former and active duty military members have been charged in the Jan. 6 assault, an attempt to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election that Democrat Biden won over Republican Trump. A recent Defense Department inspector general report showed that dozens of military members were suspected of extremist activities that included conspiring to overthrow the government, though the number represents a tiny fraction of the more than 2 million U.S. service members.\nWhen the students examined the three oaths they had sworn to, Miller said they realized there had not been much education about them -- \u201ca line by line breakdown. What does it mean? What are you really swearing your allegiance to essentially.\u201d\nThe group suggested more emphasis on the history and purpose of their oaths and also \u201cwhat you are actually swearing your allegiance to,\u201d he said. One point was showing the distinction between countries where the military professed allegiance to sovereigns or individuals as opposed to the U.S. military's oath to the Constitution.\n\u201cWe knew what it was and the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts, but we didn\u2019t really go into the why,\u201d said 1st Lt. Bryan Agustin, another of the students behind the Oath Project who is stationed at Goodfellow Air Force Base in Texas.\nAlthough the seniors had a short time before graduation, they were able to change some of the language in their commissioning ceremony, adding more history about the oath before it was administered. The incoming basic class that fall also had the history added to their ceremony. According to copies provided by the academy, the phrasing in both cases noted that the oath had its roots in the Revolutionary War and was given to support \u201cthe democratic processes and civil liberties that our Founders enumerated in the Constitution.\u201d\nSince then, the Oath Project has been instrumental in further changes, including to basic training for new students and to their handbooks. The group's work also is integrated throughout cadets' academic and military training. Future plans include symposiums for other service academies and ROTC units.\nAt West Point, the Constitution and the oaths are not only embedded throughout the curriculum, they also permeate the campus.\nConstitution Corner Monument is near student housing and a place cadets pass daily. Dedicated by members of the class of 1943 to their fallen classmates, it contains several markers that include inscriptions of their oaths and parts of the Constitution.\nInside Grant Hall, two of the alumni portraits that look down on diners and visitors loom large in the history of the oath and the civilian-military relationship. Ulysses S. Grant, who later became president, led the Union Army through the Civil War after an estimated 300 of his fellow graduates had rejected their oaths and fought for the Confederacy. Dwight D. Eisenhower was the Supreme Allied Commander in World War II who later became president and used the Insurrection Act to call on the 101st Airborne to help integrate Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\u201cThe Constitution remains absolutely central to all the things that we teach, whether it\u2019s expressly or it\u2019s tangentially connected in the courses,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Shane Reeves, dean of the academic board and a 1996 graduate.\nThe goal is training officers to win wars, but current events are intertwined, including Jan. 6, which routinely comes up in class discussions. Avoiding it would not be an option, said Reeves, whose family ties to West Point date to the 19th century. His son is due to graduate in May.\nHe said if newly minted officers cannot answer questions from their units about current events, \u201cwe would have failed.\u201d\n\u201cWe want the cadets to be thoughtful and to think through and to understand what their obligations are,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have some really important obligations \u2014 trust of the American people, trying to stay nonpartisan.\u201d\nIn Amoroso\u2019s American Politics class, the only mention of Biden and Trump, who so far has dominated the 2024 GOP primary campaign, came up in scenarios he presented about service members -\u2013 even retired ones -\u2013 speaking out in support of candidates and how that can be interpreted as the position of the military as a whole. While individuals retain the right to express themselves, it\u2019s important that the military not be seen as partisan, he said.\n\u201cWhether you like it or not, you\u2019re going to be thrust into these political conflicts,\u201d he told the cadets. No matter the circumstance, he added, their foundation should never change \u2013 loyalty to the Constitution.\n__\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.
