Forces have raided other hospitals across Gaza, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes. Hospital staff have denied the allegations and accused Israel of endangering critically ill and wounded civilians.\nIn November, after raiding and largely emptying Shifa Hospital \u2014 Gaza's largest \u2014 the military revealed what it said was a militant hideout beneath the facility and other evidence that Hamas fighters had been inside the compound. It has yet to substantiate its allegations that Shifa was a major Hamas command center, which would weigh on the question of whether it was protected under international law.\nShifa is once again treating hundreds of wounded patients and sheltering tens of thousands of displaced people under harsh conditions, according to the World Health Organization, which described its emergency room as a \u201cbloodbath.\u201d Witnesses said an Israeli strike hit the medical compound Monday, killing and wounding several people.\nINTERNATIONAL CONCERNS\nThe U.N. Security Council delayed to Tuesday a vote on an Arab-sponsored resolution calling for a halt to hostilities to allow unhindered access to humanitarian aid. Diplomats said negotiations were taking place to get the U.S. to abstain or vote \u201cyes\u201d on the resolution after it vetoed an earlier call for a cease-fire.\nFrance, the United Kingdom and Germany \u2014 some of Israel\u2019s closest allies \u2014 joined global calls for a cease-fire over the weekend. In Israel, protesters have called for negotiations with Hamas to facilitate the release of scores of hostages still held by the group.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will keep fighting until it ends Hamas rule in Gaza, crushes its military capabilities and frees all the hostages taken during the Oct. 7 attack. For now, at least, he seems to have full U.S. support for a campaign that could last months or years.\nSpeaking alongside Austin, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said only that \u201cthe war will take time.\u201d\nMilitants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on Oct. 7 and abducted 240 others. Nearly half were released in November during a weeklong cease-fire, in exchange for Israel releasing 240 Palestinian prisoners. Those released on both sides were mainly women and children.\nHOSTAGE TALKS\nCIA Director William Burns met in Warsaw with the head of Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence agency and the prime minister of Qatar on Monday, the first known meeting of the three since the cease-fire, which they had played a key role in brokering. But U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the talks were not \u201cat a point where another deal is imminent.\u201d\nAiming to increase public pressure on the Israeli government, Hamas released a video late Monday showing three older Israeli hostages pleading for Israel to bring them home.\nThe comments were likely made under duress, but the video signaled Hamas wants to move on to discussions of releasing sick and old men. Israel has said it wants around 19 women and two children freed first. Hamas says the women include soldiers, for whom it is expected to make greater demands.\nHamas and other militants are still holding an estimated 129 captives.\nMore than 19,400 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which has said that most are women and minors and that thousands more are buried under rubble. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.\nIsrael\u2019s military says 131 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza ground offensive. It says it has killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas, saying it uses them as human shields, but the military rarely comments on individual strikes.\n___\nMagdy reported from Cairo.\n___\nFind more of AP\u2019s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Israel strikes south Gaza and raids a hospital in the north as war grinds on with renewed US support", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/gaza-ap-hamas-israel-palestinians-b2466421.html"}
