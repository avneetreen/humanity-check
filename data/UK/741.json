You can read the full report of our coverage for more. But here is a summary of the latest developments: A UN official has warned on Monday that \u201can even more hellish scenario\u201d looms in Gaza in which humanitarian aid simply grinds to a halt. Agence France-Presse has reported that \u201cThe conditions required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist,\u201d said Lynn Hastings, UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories. Since the end of a seven-day truce, Israeli forces have pushed into southern Gaza, \u201cforcing tens of thousands \u2026 into increasingly compressed spaces, desperate to find food, water, shelter and safety,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cNowhere is safe in Gaza and there is nowhere left to go.\u201d\nIsrael\u2019s military expanded ground operations deeper into southern Gaza, with dozens of Israeli tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers entering the Gaza Strip near Khan Younis. Witnesses said Israeli military vehicles were on the southern section of the main north-to-south road in Gaza, \u201cfiring bullets and tank shells at cars and people trying to move through the area\u201d. Israeli military issued fresh orders to Palestinians in about 20 areas of central Gaza to move farther south, posting maps online.\nThe Israeli army has denied telling the World Health Organization to empty an aid warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours before ground operations in the area render it unusable. The Israeli defence ministry body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, COGAT said on X \u201cThe truth is that we didn\u2019t ask you to evacuate the warehouses and we also made it clear (and in writing) to the relevant UN representatives\u201d. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X on Monday: \u201cToday, WHO received notification from the Israel Defense Forces that we should remove our supplies from our medical warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours, as ground operations will put it beyond use\u2026 We appeal to Israel to withdraw the order, and take every possible measure to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and humanitarian facilities,\u201d he wrote.\nThe White House said Hamas broke an agreement to release more women hostages, and its refusal to do so was the cause of the collapse of the week-long truce with Israel on Friday. In a briefing at the White House on Monday afternoon, US national security advisor Jake Sullivan said \u201cit is that refusal by Hamas that has caused the end of the hostage agreement, and therefore the end of the pause in hostilities\u201d. He it was \u201ctoo soon\u201d to judge if Israel provided enough notice, or done enough to inform Palestinian civilians where it would be safe as it moved into southern Gaza, but said the US warned Israel civilians must be protected.\n5 Dec 2023 03.23 CET The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Israel has assembled a large system of pumps that may be used to flood tunnels used by Hamas under the Gaza Strip in a bid to drive out fighters. The paper is citing US officials as the source, but says the plan could threaten Gaza\u2019s water supply. The Wall Street Journal also said an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official declined to comment on the flooding plan but was quoted as saying: \u201cThe IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas\u2019s terror capabilities in various ways, using different military and technological tools.\u201d\n5 Dec 2023 02.45 CET The Israeli army has denied telling the World Health Organization to empty an aid warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours before ground operations in the area render it unusable. The Israeli defence ministry body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, COGAT said on X \u201cThe truth is that we didn\u2019t ask you to evacuate the warehouses and we also made it clear (and in writing) to the relevant UN representatives\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X on Monday: \u201cToday, WHO received notification from the Israel Defense Forces that we should remove our supplies from our medical warehouse in southern Gaza within 24 hours, as ground operations will put it beyond use\u201d. \u201cWe appeal to Israel to withdraw the order, and take every possible measure to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and humanitarian facilities,\u201d he wrote. At a press conference earlier on Monday, the WHO regional director for the eastern Mediterranean, Ahmed al-Mandhari, said the intensification of military ground operations in southern Gaza risked depriving thousands of people of health care, Agence France-Presse reports. \u201cWe saw what happened in the north of Gaza. This cannot serve as a model for the south,\u201d he said.\n5 Dec 2023 01.46 CET The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) says on X and Telegram that it has fired on Hezbollah in Lebanon with \u201cIAF fighter jets\u201d. It says it is in response to a strike by Hezbollah from Lebanon to Israel on Monday. \u05de\u05d8\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9 \u05e7\u05e8\u05d1 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d7\u05d9\u05dc \u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8 \u05ea\u05e7\u05e4\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d6\u05de\u05df \u05e7\u05e6\u05e8 \u05e2\u05de\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05d9\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8, \u05ea\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9\u05ea \u05d8\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d5\u05de\u05d1\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e6\u05d1\u05d0\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d0\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05d8\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d7\u05d9\u05d6\u05d1\u05d0\u05dc\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e9\u05d8\u05d7 \u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05df \u05d1\u05ea\u05d2\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e9\u05d9\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e9\u05d8\u05d7 \u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05ea \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05de\u05e9 >> pic.twitter.com/CRNNzo3kb1 \u2014 \u05e6\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d4\u05d4\u05d2\u05e0\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc (@idfonline) December 5, 2023\n5 Dec 2023 01.29 CET Unicef Spokesperson James Elder has posted a video on X a couple of hours ago about children being injured and praised the commitment of the health staff. According to the video, he\u2019s in Nasser hospital in the Gaza Strip. Elder says in the video: We keep saying it\u2019s a war zone, this is again what it looks like Somehow, amid the never-ending attacks in Khan Yonis #Gaza the health workers just keep responding.

Israeli warplanes are reported to have heavily bombarded an area around Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Monday. The expanded assault posed a choice for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians \u2013 either stay in the path of Israeli forces or flee within the confines of southern Gaza with no guarantee of safety. Aid workers have warned that the mass movement would worsen the already dire humanitarian catastrophe in the territory. \u201cAnother wave of displacement is underway, and the humanitarian situation worsens by the hour,\u201d the Gaza chief of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, Thomas White, said in a post on X. Thomas White also described the scene yesterday: Another wave of displacement is underway, and the humanitarian situation worsens by the hour.\nThe roads leading South towards Rafah are clogged with cars and donkey carts packed with people and their meagre possessions. \u2014 Thomas White (@TomWhiteGaza) December 4, 2023\n4 Dec 2023 00.51 CET Australia\u2019s deputy prime minister says the country remains a safe place for Jewish people, despite Israel issuing travel warnings for its citizens looking to visit. Israel has upgraded travel warnings to multiple countries, including Australia, after a rise in antisemitism stemming from the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, Australian Associated Press is reporting. Travel warnings to Australia have been raised to level 2, which urges Israeli citizens to take additional precautions while visiting. Richard Marles has urged greater social cohesion in Australia after the conflict. He told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: It\u2019s really important that all of us, in what is a very difficult time globally, are looking after each other\u2026 It is very important that as people legitimately express their views about what\u2019s happening in the world, this is done in a peaceful manner \u2026 many in the Jewish community are finding this to be a very difficult time.\n4 Dec 2023 00.31 CET A UN official has warned on Monday that \u201can even more hellish scenario\u201d looms in Gaza in which humanitarian aid simply grinds to a halt.

Here is a summary of the latest developments in the Israel-Hamas conflict as it nears the two-month mark: Israel\u2019s military expanded ground operations deeper into southern Gaza, with dozens of Israeli tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers entering the Gaza Strip near Khan Younis. Witnesses said Israeli military vehicles were on the southern section of the main north-to-south road in Gaza, \u201cfiring bullets and tank shells at cars and people trying to move through the area\u201d. Israeli military issued fresh orders to Palestinians in about 20 areas of central Gaza to move farther south, posting maps online.\nThe White House said Hamas broke an agreement to release more women hostages, and its refusal to do so was the cause of the collapse of the week-long truce with Israel on Friday. In a briefing at the White House on Monday afternoon, US national security advisor Jake Sullivan said \u201cit is that refusal by Hamas that has caused the end of the hostage agreement, and therefore the end of the pause in hostilities\u201d. He it was \u201ctoo soon\u201d to judge if Israel provided enough notice, or done enough to inform Palestinian civilians where it would be safe as it moved into southern Gaza, but said the US warned Israel civilians must be protected.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) issued a statement expressing \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the resumption of hostilities and bombardment of southern Gaza, and warned \u201cnowhere is safe\u201d for civilians in Gaza. The WHO said it was appealing to Israel for protection of the health system from further attacks and degradation of its capacity, and feared a repeat of the collapse of hospitals and other essential services in the north.\nA Hamas rocket fired during the 7 October attacks struck an Israeli military base where many of the country\u2019s nuclear-capable missiles are believed to have been stored, the New York Times said in a report. None of the missiles were struck, although the attack on the Sdot Micha base in central Israel set a fire that \u201capproached missile storage facilities and other sensitive weaponry\u201d, according to the newspaper\u2019s visual analysis.\nHamas engaged in years of planning, drawing up detailed maps with the help of spies inside Israel ahead of the 7 October attack, the country\u2019s military concluded after examining vast quantities of phones, notebooks and documents seized from gunmen on the battlefield and in Gaza. Fighters also carried guides to hostage-taking and Arabic-to-Hebrew phrasebooks, one of which included the line \u201cput your hands up and spread your legs\u201d. The document was included in a cache of material that was released on Monday by the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 Amshat military intelligence unit.\nMatthew Miller, a US state department spokesperson, said Hamas continued to hold female Israeli hostages because it did not want them to reveal what they experienced in captivity. Hamas fighters committed widespread \u201cgender-based atrocities and sexual violence\u201d during the 7 October attacks according to Israeli police who say they have evidence of more than 1,500 incidents. \u201cThe fact [Hamas] continue to hold women hostages, the fact that they continue to hold children hostages \u2026 and the reason this pause fell apart, is they don\u2019t want those women to be able to talk about what happened to them during their time in custody,\u201d Miller told a media briefing.\nGaza\u2019s health ministry issued new casualty figures, saying that 15,899 Palestinians have been killed by Israel\u2019s military campaign in the Gaza Strip since 7 October. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government in the Gaza Strip, says that 70% of those who have been killed are women and children. It does not distinguish in the figures between civilians and combatants. The number of deaths is likely under-counted, as the collapse of the health system in Gaza has made it difficult for statistics to be gathered, and there are more than 6,000 Palestinians considered missing within the territory.\nThe head of the International Committee of the Red Cross described the suffering in Gaza as \u201cintolerable\u201d while visiting the territory. Mirjana Spoljaric Egger said: \u201cThe level of human suffering is intolerable. It is unacceptable that civilians have no safe place to go in Gaza.\u201d\nTelecoms company PalTel said that Gaza is facing a communications blackout , with all telecom services (landline, cellular and internet) in Gaza City and north Gaza Strip lost due to the disconnection of main elements of the network.\nIsrael \u2019s military has again said it has fired into Lebanon at the site of launches it claimed were directed into Israel. It said \u201ca number of launches from Lebanon\u201d had occurred, and that they had fallen in open areas, with no casualties as a result. Earlier on Monday it said that three soldiers had been \u201cslightly injured\u201d by fire from Lebanon at an Israeli military site.\nSix hostages from Thailand kidnapped and held for weeks in the Gaza Strip by Hamas arrived back in the kingdom on Monday. Israel believes that Hamas still holds about 137 people hostage in Gaza.\nAt least 60 Palestinians were arrested in the occupied West Bank overnight, Al Jazeera reported, with Israeli forces carrying out raids in the cities of Qalqilya, Jericho, Jenin and Tulkarem. At least 30 armoured vehicles were deployed in Jenin following a dawn raid, the broadcaster reported.\nUpdated at 00.10 CET\n4 Dec 2023 23.42 CET WHO: 'Nowhere is safe in Gaza' The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a statement expressing its \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the resumption of hostilities between Hamas and Israel in Gaza, the bombardment of southern Gaza, and warns that \u201cnowhere is safe\u201d for civilians.

We have seen what happened in northern Gaza. This cannot be the blueprint for the south. Gaza cannot afford to lose another hospital as health needs continue to soar. As more civilians in southern Gaza receive immediate evacuation orders and are forced to move, more people are being concentrated into smaller areas, while the remaining hospitals in those areas run without sufficient fuel, medicines, food, water, or protection of health workers.
