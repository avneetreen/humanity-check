It said the balloon was monitored flying at an altitude of approximately 6,400 meters (21,000 feet).\nIt also said 26 Chinese military aircraft were detected, along with 10 Chinese navy ships, in the 24 hours before 6 a.m. Friday. Of the aircraft, 15 had crossed the median line that is an unofficial divider between the sides, but which Beijing refuses to recognize. Some also entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone outside the island's airspace.\nTaiwan\u2019s military monitored the situation with combat aircraft, navy vessels and land-based missile systems, the ministry said.\nSuch incursions occur regularly as a means of advertising China\u2019s threat to use force to annex the self-governing island republic it considers its own territory, wear down Taiwan\u2019s military capabilities, and impact morale among the armed forces and the public, who remain largely ambivalent to China\u2019s actions.\nThe Chinese missions have also prompted Taiwan to up its purchases of aircraft from the United States, its chief ally, and revitalize its own defense industry, including producing submarines.\nBeijing strongly protests all contacts between the island and the U.S., but its aggressive diplomacy has helped build strong bipartisan support for Taipei on Capitol Hill.\nU.S. President Joe Biden vowed sharper rules to track, monitor and potentially shoot down unknown aerial objects after three weeks of high-stakes drama sparked by the discovery of a suspected Chinese spy balloon transiting much of the country early in the year.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "A Chinese military surveillance balloon is spotted in Taiwan Strait, island's Defense Ministry says", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/taiwan-strait-ap-chinese-taipei-china-b2460607.html"}
