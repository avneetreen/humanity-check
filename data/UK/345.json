Photograph: Nastya Ivleeva A raunchy celebrity-studded party in Moscow has prompted outrage among Russian politicians and law enforcement agencies, in one of the starkest examples to date of how Vladimir Putin is moving the country in a conservative and anti-liberal direction. The party, which took place on 20 December, was a dress-up ball held at a Moscow nightclub with the theme \u201calmost naked\u201d, and was organised by the popular Instagram influencer Anastasia Ivleeva and attended by a number of household celebrity names who have stayed in the country since Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The scantily clad stars wore flesh-coloured mesh, lace, and lingerie, with one rapper attending in nothing but a sock, in what appeared to be a tribute to the famous 1987 Red Hot Chili Peppers album cover. \u201cEveryone was having a good time, no one could imagine what a mess this would all become,\u201d said one person who attended the party who asked not to be named.

Russia said 59 people drowned in the territory it controls. But an AP investigation claims the number is at least in the hundreds in the town of Oleshky alone. Health workers and others who were in Oleshky told the news agency that Russian authorities hid the true number by taking control of the issuance of death certificates, immediately removing bodies not claimed by family, and preventing local health workers and volunteers from dealing with the dead people. An exact death toll \u2013 in Oleshky, the occupied area\u2019s most populous town before the war, and beyond \u2013 may never be known, even if Ukrainian forces retake the territory and are able to investigate. \u201cThe scale of this tragedy, not just Russia, but even Ukraine doesn\u2019t realise,\u201d said Svitlana, a nurse who initially oversaw the process of collecting death certificates and later escaped to Ukrainian-controlled territory. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge tragedy.\u201d\nUpdated at 15.37 CET\n28 Dec 2023 13.37 CET Here are some further comments from the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, coming to us via Reuters.

He added he believed there were signs the west was changing its tactics and strategy on Ukraine. Lavrov said: The west is really changing its tactics \u2013 maybe even thinking about clarifying the strategy. Because if the \u2018strategic defeat of Russia\u2019 is a strategy, forgive the tautology, then this strategy failed miserably. There are some approaches, some whispers: why don\u2019t you [Russia] meet with someone in Europe who would be ready to talk, talk about Ukraine without Ukraine itself.\u201d\nUpdated at 13.40 CET\n28 Dec 2023 13.28 CET Two Russian men sentenced to prison terms for reciting poetry criticising Russia's invasion of Ukraine View image in fullscreen Russian poets Artyom Kamardin (left) and Yegor Shtovba (right) pictured during their verdict announcement at a court in Moscow on 28 December 2023. Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images Two Russian men have been sentenced to long prison terms for reading poems criticising Russia\u2019s military assault on Ukraine. Artyom Kamardin was sentenced to seven years and Yegor Shtovba to five years and six months to cries of \u201cShame!\u201d from their supporters in the courtroom, according to Agence France-Presse. Kamardin, 33, said his detention in September 2022 was violent, claiming officers raped him and forced him to film an apology video while threatening his then girlfriend Alexandra Popova, now his wife. On the eve of his arrest he had recited his poem \u201cKill me, militia man!\u201d on a Moscow square where dissidents have been gathering since the Soviet era. Kamardin also shouted slogans against the imperial \u201cNew Russia\u201d project aiming to annex the south of Ukraine. Both men were convicted of \u201cinciting hatred\u201d and \u201ccalling for activities threatening state security\u201d. Kamardin told the court he did not know his actions broke the law and asked for mercy. \u201cI am not a hero, and going to prison for my beliefs was never in my plans,\u201d he said in a statement, posted on his supporters\u2019 Telegram channel. Shtovba, 23, also said he did not break the law. In his last statement in court, published by independent site Mediazona, he asked the judge: \u201cWhat have I done that\u2019s illegal? Read poetry?\u201d Nikolai Dayneko, who was arrested at the same time, was sentenced to four years in prison last May after entering a pre-trial agreement, according to OVD-info. This is the latest in a string of heavy sentences against Russians who have protested against the invasion of Ukraine, in trials critics have denounced as absurd.\nUpdated at 13.35 CET\n28 Dec 2023 13.09 CET Footage has been posted that appears to show the Kherson railway station after Russian forces\u2019 shelling on 26 December in which one policeman was killed and four people were injured. A train was set to evacuate residents when the shelling took place. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said after the incident that about 140 civilians had been at the station in the early evening and quick action by police to direct them away saved many lives.

It was the latest incident of a civilian vessel hitting an explosive in the Black Sea in what Kyiv says is a further example of stepped-up Russian attacks on shipping and port infrastructure, Reuters has reported. Ukraine\u2019s southern military command said on Telegram: A Panama-flagged civilian vessel was blown up on an enemy sea mine in the Black Sea...The vessel lost its course and control, and a fire broke out on the upper deck. A captain and a sailor, an Egyptian citizen, were injured, with the latter hospitalised in the city of Izmail, the head of the Odesa regional prosecutor\u2019s office said at a briefing. He added that the incident happened early on Wednesday at a river mouth. Moscow has increased attacks on Ukraine\u2019s port infrastructure since mid-July, when it quit a UN-brokered deal that allowed safe passage of Ukrainian grain shipments via the Black Sea. Kyiv since has established an alternative route, which hugs the western shores of the Black Sea. It said Russian forces have been repeatedly dropping explosive devices in its vicinity.\nUpdated at 13.02 CET\n28 Dec 2023 11.56 CET The UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps, has said Russia \u201cmisled\u201d when it claimed the Novocherkassk was \u201cdamaged\u201d.
