Command\u2019s member states strongly condemned North Korea\u2019s \u201cunlawful\u201d nuclear and ballistic missile programs which violate multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions and called for Pyongyang to recommit to diplomacy aimed at defusing the nuclear standoff.\nThe U.N. Command\u2019s member states also declared \u201cthey will be united upon any renewal of hostilities or armed attack on the Korean Peninsula challenging the principles of the United Nations and the security of (South Korea).\u201d\nShin during a speech at the meeting said the North would face a \u201cstrong response from the international community centered on the U.N. Command\u201d if it ever attempts to invade the South again. He also issued a veiled warning toward Pyongyang\u2019s growing alignment with Russia and China, as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un tries to break out of diplomatic isolation and insert Pyongyang as part of a united front against Washington.\n\u201cIf the countries that supported North Korea during the Korean War offer to do so again, they too will face the same punishment as North Korea,\u201d Shin said.\nThe Korean War was triggered by a North Korean sneak attack on the South in June 1950. The North was backed by forces from the newly formed People\u2019s Republic of China, which was aided by the then-Soviet Union's air force.\nSouth Korea, the United States and troops from various countries under the direction of the United Nations fought to push back the invasion before the fighting was halted by an armistice in 1953, leaving the Korean Peninsula in a technical state of war. The U.N. Command has since remained in the South to enforce and maintain the armistice.\nBefore Tuesday\u2019s meeting, North Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned the event as reflecting a \u201cdangerous scheme to ignite a new war of aggression.\u201d The North\u2019s state media also criticized the visits by Austin and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who traveled to Seoul last week, calling them \u201cwarmongers\u201d brining a \u201cnew war cloud\u201d to Asia.\nAnimosity between the Koreas has spiked recent months after Kim ramped up his weapons demonstrations, including events he described as simulated nuclear attacks on the South, and also authorized his military to launch pre-emptive nuclear strikes against enemies if it perceives Pyongyang\u2019s top leadership as under threat.\nSouth Korea has responded by expanding its combined military exercises with the United States as well as trilateral security cooperation with Japan. Seoul has also been seeking stronger public assurances from Washington that the United States would swiftly and decisively use its nukes to protect the South in the face of a North Korean nuclear attack.\nDuring their annual Security Consultative Meeting on Monday, Austin and Shin signed a new version of their countries\u2019 Tailored Deterrence Strategy agreement, which was revised for the first time in a decade to address the growing threat of the North\u2019s military nuclear program.\nShin said the new document spells out that the United States would mobilize its full range of military capabilities, including nuclear ones, to defend the South in the event of a North Korean nuclear attack. He also said the document will provide a template for the allies to strategize how South Korea could assist U.S. nuclear operations in such events with its conventional capabilities but didn\u2019t elaborate further.\nWhile Kim is also trying to strengthen relations with China, Russia has been his primary focus. A flurry of diplomacy between the countries, highlighted by a September summit between Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin, has triggered concerns about an arms arrangement in which North Korea provides badly needed munitions to Russia to help it wage war on Ukraine in exchange for Russian technology transfers that would upgrade Kim\u2019s military nuclear program.\nA Russian delegation led by Alexander Kozlov, minister of natural resources, arrived at Pyongyang's airport Tuesday, in the latest sign of diplomatic activity. While The Associated Press photographed the arrival, the North\u2019s state media did not immediately release details of the visit.\nIn written responses to questions from AP, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said he will discuss the international response to the purported weapons deal between North Korea and Russia during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco this week. He said such military cooperation between the countries not only poses a serious threat to the security of Asia and Europe but also undermines the rules-based international order.\nBoth Pyongyang and Moscow have denied U.S. and South Korean claims that the North has been supplying munitions and military equipment to Russia.\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "South Korea and members of the US-led UN command warn North Korea over its nuclear threat", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/north-ap-south-korea-north-korea-kim-jong-un-b2446795.html"}
