He vowed to 'resign Hamas to the dustbin of history,' even as military experts warned of the daunting threat posed by Hamas' network of miles of tunnels under Gaza.\n'The Bible says there is a time for peace and a time for war. This is a time for war,' the Israeli PM said.\nThere has been a marked increase in attacks on U.S. forces since the conflict in Israel broke out on Oct. 7 and Iraqi armed groups aligned with Iran threatened to target U.S. interests with missiles and drones if Washington intervened to support Israel against Hamas in Gaza.\nThe Pentagon has dispatched US Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) to the region as a form of force protection\nThe Pentagon has dispatched the USS Gerald R. Ford (pictured) and USS Dwight D. Eisenhower to the region\nIsraeli forces have exchanged fire with Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, raising fears of a wider war\nThe Ain al-Asad airbase in western Iraq sustained rocket damage in 2020 following the US killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. It came under fire yet again\nSmoke rises from hills above the souther Lebanese village of Maroun Al Ras, opposite the Israeli Moshav of Avivim during Israeli artillery shelling on October 25, 2023. President Biden has warned nation states and factions against exploiting the conflict\nAlthough the US has pulled back from its substantial presence in Baghdad (seen here in 2003), there are still American troops battling ISIS from inside Iraq and Syria\nA group called the 'Islamic resistance in Iraq' has endorsed Tuesday's attack.\nOn Monday, four Katyusha rockets were fired at Iraq's Ain al-Asad air base, an attack also claimed by the same group.\nIran-backed militia groups in Iraq have consistently demanded the expulsion of American troops after a U.S. air strike in Baghdad killed senior Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in 2020. The militia groups since then resorted to rocket attacks on U.S. forces in the country and the embassy in Baghdad.\nThese attacks stopped when Prime Minister Sudani - nominated by the coordination framework, the largest parliamentary bloc composed of an alliance of Iran-aligned factions - assumed power last year.\nCalls for the expulsion of U.S. troops have also been relatively quiet since then. But these demands, along with the attacks, have resumed in connection with increased Israeli bombardment on Gaza.\nIn the latest such call, on Monday, Iraqi politician Hadi Al-Amiri, leader of the Political and Military Badr organization close to Iran, urged the government to 'take all necessary measures to set a serious, specific, and short-term timetable for the exit of international coalition forces from Iraq.'\nAmiri's call comes a few days after Iraq's Shi'ite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr called on the Iraqi government and lawmakers to close the U.S. embassy in Baghdad in response to Washington's 'unfettered support' for Israel.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "American troops in the Middle East targeted for the 25TH TIME: Iraq base hit by drone strike hours after White House said it's holding Iran 'accountable'", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12693187/American-troops-Middle-East-targeted-25TH-TIME-Iraq-base-hit-drone-strike-hours-White-House-said-holding-Iran-accountable.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"}
