In the last few hours, Israeli soldiers have stormed Gaza\u2019s Al-Shifa hospital. Israel says that the raid, which is still underway, is a \u201cprecise and targeted operation against Hamas\u201d, which it accuses of operating a command centre beneath the medical facility, a claim Hamas denies.\nThe attack at al-Shifa is militarily significant \u2013 but it is also taking place in the arena of an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe that has drawn huge global attention, with conditions rapidly deteriorating on the site since the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) surrounded it last week. And so whether Israel is able to carry out the pinpoint attack it has promised is likely to be a critical test of the international community\u2019s view of its conduct of the war.\nIsrael says that it will do everything in its power to protect patients, medical staff, and others sheltering on the site. But there have already been claims of civilians coming under fire as they sought to flee. For the very latest, head to the live blog.

Photograph: APAImages/Shutterstock\nThe Dar al-Shifa (House of Healing) hospital is the most advanced in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. There are about 600 patients and somewhere between 200 and 700 medics and administrators on site; figures have varied widely on the number of displaced people there, from 1,500 to 15,000, with an estimate from a doctor on Wednesday morning that 2-3,000 were sheltering at the facility.\nIsrael claims that since it pulled out of Gaza in 2005, Hamas has expanded existing basements under the complex of buildings into a sprawling command centre as part of a broader strategy of using civilians to shield its forces from Israeli attack. Hamas denies this.\nSince Friday, when Israeli tanks and snipers encircled the facility, an already dire situation has worsened. On Saturday, the hospital said that its last generator ran out of fuel, and yesterday, a health ministry spokesperson said that mass graves were being dug on site to deal with about 100 decomposing bodies. A key question about this morning\u2019s attack is whether it will put those civilians on site in still greater danger, or end the situation rapidly and allow them to escape or get the medical supplies they need.\nWhat do we know about the attack so far?\nAt about 1am local time, Israel told officials in Gaza that it intended to raid the hospital complex in \u201cthe coming minutes\u201d. Later, the IDF confirmed that an attack was underway and said that it was strictly targeted on an area of the hospital where it said Hamas was operating. It said that its forces had undergone special training for the \u201ccomplex and sensitive environment\u201d and that medical teams and Arabic speakers had gone in as part of the operation.\nDr Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the Gaza health ministry, told Al Jazeera that Israeli forces had raided the western side of the site. There were also reports of tanks inside the complex. A Gaza health ministry spokesperson said that the IDF had reached the basement and was \u201cshooting and carrying out bombings\u201d, while an eyewitness told the BBC that they had seen soldiers entering a specialised surgical department. None of these claims have been independently verified by the Guardian.\nWhat impact has the situation had on patients?\nBefore the attack began, the UN said that 32 patients had died so far, as well as three nurses. Those physically able to leave were already frightened to do so: healthcare worker Goudhat Samy al-Madhoun told AP that Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) fired on a group of about 50 who were attempting to flee the facility on Monday despite promises of safe passage. Al-Madhoun said Israeli forces fired on the group several times, wounding one man, who had to be left behind.\nWithout the fuel needed to keep crucial equipment running, the humanitarian situation has been deteriorating rapidly. Munir al-Boursh, a doctor and Palestinian health ministry undersecretary who spoke to the Guardian\u2019s Ruth Michaelson, said that there were no oxygen supplies or light to conduct surgery, and that six operating theatres were out of action.\nMeanwhile, photographs from Reuters published on Monday showed premature babies weighing less than 1.5kg, who had been removed from incubators, lying huddled together on ordinary beds in an operating theatre. \u201cYesterday I had 39 babies and today they have become 36,\u201d Dr Mohamed Tabasha, head of the paediatric department, said then. \u201cI cannot say how long they can last.\u201d\nThe IDF has said that it is arranging the transfer of incubators from Israel; Gaza health ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said that no such plan was in place before the raid. Israel also says that it left 300 litres of fuel at the entrance to the complex on Sunday but that Hamas stopped the hospital from taking it.\nBut the hospital needs 10,000 litres of fuel a day. Hospital director Mohammad Abu Salmiya told CNN that the Israeli offer would be enough to power the facility for half an hour, and that staff had been too scared to retrieve the fuel given how small a difference it would make. Hospital officials have called for any delivery to be made by a neutral body like the International Committee of the Red Cross.\nWhy is Israel targeting the hospital?\nView image in fullscreen An aerial view shows the compound of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on 7 November 2023. Photograph: Bashar Taleb/AFP/Getty Images\nIt says that since the 7 October attacks that killed 1,200 Israelis, senior Hamas leaders have been based there. Israeli army spokesperson Lt Col Peter Lerner told CNN the hospital and compound were for Hamas \u201ca central hub of their operations, perhaps even the beating heart and maybe even a centre of gravity\u201d.\nIsraeli officials quoted in the New York Times claimed that Al-Shifa was spared during past operations in Gaza out of deference to civilian patients and staff but that it was now a key Israeli target.\nIn an analysis piece on Sunday, Jason Burke wrote that Israel intends to dismantle Hamas\u2019s ability to govern Gaza, and quoted Prof Kobi Michael of the Institute of National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, who said: \u201cIn this war we have to dismantle the elements of Hamas that will prevent Hamas from becoming a military threat again or a government again.\u201d\nWhat is the evidence for claims that Hamas is headquartered under the hospital?\nThe IDF has released footage which it says is of two interrogations of Hamas militants who allegedly confirm that the organisation has a command centre hidden at al-Shifa. It has also released audio recordings said to capture other militants discussing the command centre, and claims to have further intelligence supporting its case. (The authenticity of other audio recordings released as evidence by Israel has been disputed.)\nThe US said on Tuesday that its own intelligence supported Israel\u2019s conclusions \u2013 a move which Hamas said this morning had given a \u201cgreen light\u201d for the raid.\nHamas, and medical staff on site including the hospital director, deny that there is any Hamas presence there. The NGO Human Rights Watch has also said it is unable to corroborate the allegation. The health ministry in Gaza has invited an independent inspection, but others have dismissed that suggestion as impractical in the current circumstances.\nIs Israel entitled to take military action at the hospital?\nRegardless of the truth of the claim, Israel has been urged to spare the hospital and the civilians there. Joe Biden said on Monday that \u201cthe hospital must be protected\u201d, and others including the World Health Organization and Unicef have called for an end to all attacks on hospitals. After the operation was announced, a White House spokesperson said that the US did not wish to see a firefight in the hospital \u201cwhere innocent people, helpless people, sick people trying to get medical care they deserve are caught in the crossfire\u201d.\nThe Geneva convention provides special protection for civilian hospitals, saying that they should \u201cin no circumstances be the object of attack\u201d. But it adds that such protection can be rescinded if a hospital is used for \u201cacts harmful to the enemy\u201d, like concealing fighters or weapons. If so, there is still a requirement for due warning and a \u201creasonable time limit\u201d for the acts to stop.\nCordula Droege, chief legal officer of the ICRC, said that the law also prohibits any action that prevents hospitals from treating the sick. There was no \u201cfree licence to attack\u201d, she said. \u201cEvery attack is subject to the principles of proportionality and precaution. This means that the party to the conflict has to do everything feasible to avoid or at least minimise harm to patients and medical staff.\u201d\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But under international law, that fact does not in its own right justify an attack on a hospital unless all possible measures have been taken to protect the civilians in the firing line.\nThat is why Israel insists there is \u201cno siege\u201d at al-Shifa, that it has provided evacuation routes for civilians, and that it gave Hamas authorities 12 hours notice that any military operation inside the facility must cease before the operation. began. And it is why such close scrutiny will now be applied to whether the IDF does everything in its power to protect the civilians who are still in the hospital as the battle rages.\nWhat else we\u2019ve been reading\nView image in fullscreen Anna Richardson Photograph: \u00a9 Channel Four Television Corporation\nJazz singer Norma Winstone was pretty nonchalant about the fact that rapper Drake used her vocals on a song from his most recent album until her son, a fellow musician, told her who he was.

Photograph: Courtesy of KC Caviar\nFor a long time, the only way most people extracted eggs from sturgeons to make caviar was by beating the fish on the head to death before cutting its belly open. When polar and marine scientist Angela K\u00f6hler saw this happen, she knew she had to figure out a way to produce \u201cno kill caviar\u201d.\nExtracting the eggs like this is not only an ethical issue, it\u2019s also a financial problem. Depending on the species of sturgeon, the fish do not start spawning for a minimum of eight to 15 years. Killing the fish is \u201ceconomically insane\u201d, K\u00f6hler said. After four years of researching, K\u00f6hler developed a new method to extract the eggs. An ultrasound is carried out to check the eggs are ready and then the bellies of the fish are gently massaged so that they are naturally released. It is a far more humane process.\nSturgeons are one of the most critically endangered species in the world because of overfishing and poaching, so K\u00f6hler\u2019s extraction technique could prove to be a crucial method of preservation. \u201cIt should be a no-brainer to invest in this slaughter-free technology,\u201d she says.\nSign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday\nBored at work?\nAnd finally, the Guardian\u2019s puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day \u2013 with plenty more on the Guardian\u2019s Puzzles app for iOS and Android.
