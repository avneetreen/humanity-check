It has killed more civilians than the U.S.-led coalition did in its three-year campaign against the Islamic State group.\nThe Israeli military has said little about what kinds of bombs and artillery it is using in Gaza. But from blast fragments found on-site and analyses of strike footage, experts are confident that the vast majority of bombs dropped on the besieged enclave are U.S.-made. They say the weapons include 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) \u201cbunker-busters\u201d that have killed hundreds in densely populated areas.\nWith the Palestinian death toll in Gaza approaching 20,000, the international community is calling for a cease-fire. Israel vows to press ahead, saying it wants to destroy Hamas\u2019 military capabilities following the militant group\u2019s Oct. 7 cross-border rampage that triggered the war, in which it killed 1,200 people and took 240 others hostage.\nThe Biden administration has quietly continued to supply arms to Israel. Last week, however, President Joe Biden publicly acknowledged that Israel was losing international legitimacy for what he called its \u201cindiscriminate bombing.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a look at what is known so far about Israel\u2019s campaign on Gaza.\nHow much destruction is there in Gaza?\nIsrael\u2019s offensive has destroyed over two-thirds of all structures in northern Gaza and a quarter of buildings in the southern area of Khan Younis, according to an analysis of Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite data by Corey Scher of the CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University, experts in mapping damage during wartime.\nThe percentage of damaged buildings in the Khan Younis area nearly doubled in just the first two weeks of Israel's southern offensive, they said.\nThat includes tens of thousands of homes as well as schools, hospitals, mosques and stores. U.N. monitors have said that about 70% of school buildings across Gaza have been damaged. At least 56 damaged schools served as shelters for displaced civilians. Israeli strikes damaged 110 mosques and three churches, the monitors said.\nIsrael holds Hamas responsible for civilian deaths by embedding militants in civilian infrastructure. Those sites also shelter multitudes of Palestinians who have fled under Israeli evacuation orders.\n\u201cGaza is now a different color from space. It\u2019s a different texture,\u201d said Scher, who has worked with Van Den Hoek to map destruction across several war zones, from Aleppo to Mariupol.\nHow does the destruction stack up historically?\nBy some measures, destruction in Gaza has outpaced Allied bombings of Germany during World War II.\nBetween 1942 and 1945, the allies attacked 51 major German cities and towns, destroying about 40-50% of their urban areas, said Robert Pape, a U.S. military historian. Pape said this amounted to 10% of buildings across Germany, compared to over 33% across Gaza, a densely populated territory of just 140 square miles (360 square kilometers).\n\u201cGaza is one of the most intense civilian punishment campaigns in history,\u201d said Pape. \u201cIt now sits comfortably in the top quartile of the most devastating bombing campaigns ever.\u201d\nThe U.S.-led coalition\u2019s 2017 assault to expel the Islamic State group from the Iraqi city of Mosul was considered one of the most intense attacks on a city in generations. That nine-month battle killed around 10,000 civilians, a third of them from coalition bombardment, according an Associated Press investigation at the time.\nDuring the 2014-2017 campaign to defeat IS in Iraq, the coalition carried out nearly 15,000 strikes across the country, according to Airwars, a London-based independent group that tracks recent conflicts. By comparison, the Israeli military said last week it has conducted 22,000 strikes in Gaza.\nWhat types of bombs are being used?\nThe Israeli military has not specified what it is using. It says every strike is cleared by legal advisers to make sure it complies with international law.\n\u201cWe choose the right munition for each target \u2014 so it doesn\u2019t cause unnecessary damage,\u201d said the army\u2019s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari.\nWeapons experts have been able to draw conclusions by analyzing blast fragments found on-site, satellite images and videos circulated on social media. They say the findings offer only a peek into the full scope of the air war.\nSo far, fragments of American-made Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) bombs and smaller diameter bombs have been found in Gaza, according to Brian Castner, a weapons investigator with Amnesty International.\nThe JDAM bombs include precision-guided 1,000- and 2,000-pound (450-kilogram and 900-kilogram) \u201cbunker-busters.\u201d\n\u201cIt turns earth to liquid,\u201d said Marc Garlasco, a former Pentagon defense official and a war crimes investigator for the U.N. \u201cIt pancakes entire buildings.\u201d\nHe said the explosion of a 2,000-pound bomb in the open means \u201cinstant death\u201d for anyone within about 30 meters (100 feet). Lethal fragmentation can extend for up to 365 meters (1,200 feet).\nIn an Oct. 31 strike on the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya, experts say a 2,000-pound bomb killed over 100 civilians.\nExperts have also identified fragments of SPICE (Smart, Precise Impact, Cost-Effective) 2000-pound bombs, which are fitted with a GPS guidance system to make targeting more precise. Castner said the bombs are produced by the Israeli defense giant Rafael, but a recent State Department release first obtained by The New York Times showed some of the technology had been produced in the United States.\nThe Israeli military is also dropping unguided \u201cdumb\u201d bombs. Several experts pointed to two photos posted to social media by the Israeli Air Force at the start of the war showing fighter jets stocked with unguided bombs.\nIs the strategy working?\nIsrael says it has two goals: Destroy Hamas and rescue the 129 hostages still held by militants.\nEleven weeks into the war, Israel says it has destroyed many Hamas sites and hundreds of tunnel shafts and has killed 7,000 Hamas fighters out of an estimated 30,000-40,000. Israeli leaders say intense military pressure is the only way to free more hostages.\nBut some families of hostages worry that the bombing endangers their loved ones. Hostages released during a weeklong cease-fire last month recounted that their captors moved them from place to place to avoid Israeli bombardment. Hamas has claimed that several hostages died from Israeli bombs, though the claims could not be verified.\nThe level of destruction is so high because \u201cHamas is very entrenched within the civilian population,\u201d said Efraim Inbar, head of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, a think tank. He also said intense bombardment of Hamas' tunnels is needed to protect advancing Israeli ground forces from attacks.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Israel's military campaign in Gaza seen as among the most destructive in history, experts say", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/gaza-ap-israel-hamas-joe-biden-b2468091.html"}
