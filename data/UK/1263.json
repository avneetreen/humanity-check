Noting that US President Joe Biden had previously said it would be a \u201cmistake\u201d for Israel to occupy Gaza, interviewer David Muir asked Netanyahu who should govern the territory when the fighting ends.

When we don\u2019t have that security responsibility, what we have is the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn\u2019t imagine. Last month, Israel defence minister Yoav Gallant said one key objective of Israel\u2019s military campaign was to sever \u201cIsrael\u2019s responsibility for life in the Gaza Strip\u201d and establish a \u201cnew security reality for the citizens of Israel.\u201d The US has also suggested the Palestinian Authority, which administers the West Bank, could take charge in Gaza while others have suggested a consortium of Arab states could take responsibility.\nUpdated at 02.48 CET\n7 Nov 2023 04.46 CET An investigation has been launched in Los Angeles after a 69-year-old man died as a result of injuries sustained during a physical altercation between rival pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian protesters, Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office have said. In a statement identifying the man as Paul Kessler, the sheriff\u2019s office said they had \u201cnot ruled out the possibility of a hate crime\u201d. It said that police were called to the City of Thousands Oaks on Monday afternoon after reports of a physical altercation during which Kessler fell back and struck his head on the ground. He died in hospital of his injuries. It said an autopsy had been performed and the cause of death determined to be \u201cblunt force head injury and the manner of death homicide\u201d but also said the incident \u201cappears to be isolated and not part of a large effort. The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles said he was an \u201celderly Jewish man\u201d who was \u201cstruck in the head by a megaphone wielded by a pro-Palestinian protestor in Westlake Village.\u201d It said it was the fourth \u201cmajor antisemitic crime\u201d committed in Los Angeles this year and added: \u201cViolence against our people has no place in civilized society.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested in an interview with the US\u2019 ABC broadcaster that Israel may govern Gaza for an \u201cindefinite period\u201d, after the war ends. The broadcaster reports Kirby reacted to the line saying: What we support is that Hamas can\u2019t be in control of Gaza any more. We are having conversations with our Israeli counterparts about what governance in Gaza should look like post-conflict and I don\u2019t believe that any solutions have been settled upon one way or the other.\n7 Nov 2023 04.06 CET In light of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s comments that Israel may govern Gaza indefinitely after the war has ended, take a look at Patrick Wintour\u2019s piece from yesterday about what will happen in Gaza after the war has ended. The Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor looked at the various scenarios being floated, who supports them and the hurdles and opposition they face. Here\u2019s a taster: In a recent interview with the Guardian, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, ruled out going into Gaza to replace Hamas without a comprehensive agreement that includes the West Bank and the birth of a Palestinian state. Fatah fears that if it took over Gaza without a clear political horizon it would be seen as complicit in Israeli and US violence, once again being seen as Israel\u2019s security sub-contractor. Brian Katulis, from the Middle East Institute, has suggested that some of the exercises for constructing a \u201cday after\u201d regional security partnership to go into Gaza \u201csound like fantasy land because currently Arab states simply do not see eye to eye with America due to its support for the way the war is being conducted\u201d. The eventual realistic options available to the international community for the future governance of Gaza will depend in part on how Israeli politics responds to its trauma. Polls have shown personal support for Netanyahu draining away, with the main split over whether he should resign immediately or later. Read on here: What happens to Gaza the day after the war ends?

Associated Press reports that intense airstrikes on the strip are taking place before an expected push into the city\u2019s dense confines. Here are some images ahead of that move.

The student, Abdulwahab Omira, was treated for non-life-threatening injuries after being struck by an SUV. \u201cThe driver is reported to have made eye contact with the victim, accelerated and struck the victim and then driven away while shouting \u2018fuck you and your people\u2019 out the lowered window of the vehicle,\u201d according to the university\u2019s department of public safety.

Israeli news outlet Haaretz also quotes White House national security council spokesperson John Kirby as saying \u201cWe received a commitment from the Israelis that these weapons will only end up in the hands of Israeli police units. The US state department did its homework and this is the commitment we received.\u201d The assurances come in the wake of the Biden administration expressing growing concern in recent weeks over a rise in settler-led violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.\n7 Nov 2023 02.38 CET The UN security council has once again failed to agree on a resolution on the conflict, with the US calling for \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d and many others demanding a \u201chumanitarian ceasefire\u201d. The Associated Press reported that after two hours of closed-door discussions differences still remained: \u201cWe talked about humanitarian pauses and we\u2019re interested in pursuing language on that score,\u201d US deputy ambassador Robert Wood told reporters after the meeting. \u201cBut there are disagreements within the council about whether that\u2019s acceptable.\u201d UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres earlier Monday told reporters he wanted an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza and a halt to the \u201cspiral of escalation\u201d already taking place from the occupied West Bank, Lebanon and Syria to Iraq and Yemen. Guterres said international humanitarian law, which demands protection of civilians and infrastructure essential for their lives, is clearly being violated and stressed that \u201cno party to an armed conflict is above\u201d these laws. He called for the immediate unconditional release of the hostages Hamas took from Israel to Gaza in its 7 October attack. China, which holds the Security Council presidency this month, and the United Arab Emirates, the Arab representative on the council, called Monday\u2019s meeting because of the \u201ccrisis of humanity\u201d in Gaza, where more than 10,000 civilians have been killed in less than a month. UAE ambassador Lana Nusseibeh said all 15 council members \u201care fully engaged\u201d and efforts will continue to try to narrow the gaps and reach agreement on a resolution.

In the video posted last week, the Michigan Democrat accused Joe Biden of supporting the \u201cgenocide of the Palestinian people\u201d and included a warning that she believes his stance on the war will hurt his re-election chances in 2024, as her state has a significant Arab American population. In a statement sent to the Associated Press on Monday, she said: My colleagues are much more focused on silencing me \u2013 the only Palestinian American voice in Congress \u2013 than they are on ending the horrific attacks on civilians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank right now. Instead of attacking me and distorting my words, they should listen to their constituents and call for a cease-fire to save innocent lives. The video also included a clip of demonstrators chanting \u201cfrom the river to the sea,\u201d a chant that many Jews and Israelis view as calling for the eradication of Israel, though others say it can have a multitude of meanings. The spat is the latest example of a public rift dividing Democrats in Michigan.

Associated Press reports: Organisers say they were targeting the Cape Orlando vessel on Tuesday based on confidential information that it was to be loaded with weapons bound for Israel to be used in the war. Those claims could not immediately be corroborated. In an emailed statement, Air Force Lt. Col. Bryon J. McGarry, a spokesperson for the department of defense, confirmed that the vessel is under the control of the US navy\u2019s military sealift command and is supporting the movement of US military cargo. \u201cDue to operations security, DoD does not provide transit or movement details or information regarding the cargo embarked on vessels of this kind,\u201d McGarry said. The Cape Orlando vessel drew similar protests in Oakland, California, on Friday before it sailed to Tacoma.

Relatives of the dead gathered at Jerusalem\u2019s Wailing Wall to mark a month of mourning. The holy site is considered the most sacred place Jews can worship. Prayers were held marking the first month of grief, in line with Jewish tradition. Agence France Press reported: \u201cWe don\u2019t have other ways to commemorate them except with prayers, lighting candles, and having them in our heart,\u201d said Yossi Rivlin, who lost two brothers at a music festival massacre during the Hamas attack. \u201cThis unity of the Israeli nation, we feel it not only in our house but all around the country. Too bad we had to wait for this moment,\u201d the 26-year-old added. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible time. I just hope we won\u2019t forget and return to our routine.\u201d Standing before a giant Israeli flag, army chief cantor Shai Abramson gave a prayer for the departed, modified to include a blessing for security forces who \u201cpaid with their lives for the protection of Israeli land\u201d. The ceremony was the first religious commemoration organised at the Wailing Wall since 7 October. It was attended by Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet formed by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of the attack, the deadliest the nation has suffered since its founding in 1948.

Ahmed Muhanna, the director of the hospital, told Al Jazeera that there are 60 patients residing at the hospital, some of whom are in serious condition. Some 80% of the patients in al-Awda \u2013 one of Gaza\u2019s biggest hospitals \u2013 were women and children, he said. Muhanna added: We are doing the impossible to continue working in the hospital, but we have no choice after the fuel runs out.\nUpdated at 00.50 CET\n6 Nov 2023 00.28 CET US state department employees have signed a dissent memo arguing that the Biden administration should be willing to publicly criticise the Israeli government, according to a report. The memo, obtained by Politico, suggests a growing loss of confidence among US diplomats in Joe Biden\u2019s approach to the Middle East crisis, the outlet writes. The memo has two key requests: that the US support a ceasefire, and that it balance its private and public messaging toward Israel, including airing criticisms of Israeli military tactics and treatment of Palestinians that the US generally prefers to keep private. The document argues that the US\u2019s private and public messaging \u201ccontributes to regional public perceptions\u201d that it is a \u201cbiased and dishonest actor, which \u2026 at worst harms US interests worldwide\u201d. It goes on: We must publicly criticize Israel\u2019s violations of international norms such as failure to limit offensive operations to legitimate military targets. When Israel supports settler violence and illegal land seizures or employs excessive use of force against Palestinians, we must communicate publicly that this goes against our American values so that Israel does not act with impunity. Politico said it was unclear how many people had signed the memo, or if and when it was submitted to the department\u2019s dissent channel.\nUpdated at 00.31 CET\n6 Nov 2023 00.13 CET The United Arab Emirates has announced it will establish a fully equipped field hospital in the Gaza Strip to treat wounded Palestinians, according to state media. The state news agency reported that five aircraft carrying the equipment and requirements necessary for the establishment and operation of the field hospital departed from Abu Dhabi on Monday, heading to al-Arish airport in Egypt. The agency said the hospital would have a capacity of 150 beds. There was no mention of whether the UAE had reached an agreement on the initiative with Israel.\nUpdated at 00.23 CET\n6 Nov 2023 23.47 CET Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has once again rejected the idea of a ceasefire in Gaza unless hostages are released, but suggested a series of \u2018tactical little pauses\u2019 may be possible. In an interview with ABC News, Netanyahu was asked about the Biden administration\u2019s calls for temporary \u201chumanitarian\u201d pauses in the fighting to allow more aid into Gaza and for civilians to evacuate. Netanyahu said: Well, there\u2019ll be no ceasefire, general ceasefire, in Gaza without the release of our hostages. As far as tactical little pauses, an hour here, an hour there. We\u2019ve had them before, I suppose, will check the circumstances in order to enable goods, humanitarian goods to come in, or our hostages, individual hostages to leave. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a general ceasefire. He said he believed a ceasefire \u201cwill hamper the war effort\u201d and hamper the effort to get the hostages out \u201cbecause the only thing that works on these criminals in Hamas is the military pressure that we\u2019re exerting\u201d. Asked if he would agree to a ceasefire if Hamas agrees to the release of hostages, Netanyahu replied: There will be a ceasefire for that purpose.\nUpdated at 00.08 CET", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel-Hamas war: UN security council fails to agree resolution - as it happened", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/06/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-jordan-airdrops-medical-supplies-gaza-blinken-turkey-push-contain-conflict"}
