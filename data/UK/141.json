I\u2019ve seen a lot, a lot of victims, but that\u2019s really making me a bit stressed,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEven if his idea [for ending the war] \u2013 that no one has heard yet \u2013 doesn\u2019t work for us, for our people, he will do anything to implement his idea anyway. And this worries me a little,\u201d he added.\nZelenskiy said he would invite Trump to Ukraine \u2013 an offer he has previously declined to extend \u2013 but only if the former president comes through on his promise to stop the war.\n\u201cDonald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv. If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be enough to come,\u201d Zelenskiy said.\nThe Ukrainian leader\u2019s comments come after the Republican presidential frontrunner has claimed he is well positioned to negotiate an end to the war that has raged without any attempt at a negotiated settlement between the two countries for almost two years.\nIn September, Trump said that if re-elected president, he would resolve the war within 24 hours but declined to outline his peace plan. \u201cIf I tell you exactly, I lose all my bargaining chips. I mean, you can\u2019t really say exactly what you\u2019re going to do. But I would say certain things to Putin. I would say certain things to Zelenskiy,\u201d he said.\nTrump has also said he has a good relationship with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders, and repeatedly made flattering comments about the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, including describing him as a \u201csmart\u201d political player who had taken over a \u201cgreat piece of land\u201d with only minor economic sanctions.\nZelenskiy\u2019s comments come as the Biden administration has signaled it is prepared to make concessions around security at the US-Mexico border to obtain a multibillion-dollar military arms package to Ukraine currently held up by Republicans in Congress.\nTop aides to Joe Biden reportedly told lawmakers at a meeting last week that if Congress fails to authorize additional aid, Russia could win the war in a matter of weeks or months at best.\nAccording to NBC News, the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and the director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, told the meeting that Ukraine will run out of certain air defense and artillery supplies in the coming weeks. A White House official described the situation as \u201cincredibly stark\u201d.\nThey also warned that failing to supply Ukraine with more weapons could prompt US allies, including Japan and South Korea, to rethink their alliances and that a Russian victory in Ukraine \u201cwill reverberate around the world\u201d.\nSeparately, the head of the UN atomic watchdog warned that Russian mines had been re-planted in the buffer zone around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after they were removed in November.\nThe head of Ukraine\u2019s state nuclear company described the alleged planting of mines around Zaporizhzhia, which is one of world\u2019s 10 biggest nuclear power stations, as \u201canother crime\u201d by Russian forces. Its six nuclear reactors are currently offline.\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Zelenskiy slams Trump\u2019s rhetoric on stopping the war as \u2018very dangerous\u2019", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/20/zelenskiy-trump-rhetoric-very-dangerous-invitation-ukraine"}
