Wide-body aircraft is anticipated to be the dominant as well as the fastest-growing segment of the aircraft floor panel market in the foreseen future. Wide-body aircraft witnessed an enormous decline amid the pandemic, greater than all other aircraft types. Furthermore, the grounding of B787 dented the recovery that was earlier expected from the market participants. However, the long-term business outlook still seems favorable to the market participants as both, Boeing and Airbus have announced to ramp up their production rate of B787 and A350XWB, respectively, in the coming years. Concurrently, the introduction of a fuel-efficient variant of the existing aircraft program (B777x) is likely to stir market growth in the years to come.\nBased on core material type - The market is segmented as nomex honeycomb, aluminum honeycomb, and others. Nomex honeycomb material type is expected to be the dominant as well as fastest-growing core material type in the market during the forecast period. It is used extensively in all types of aircraft including narrow-body and wide-body ones. Nomex honeycomb has many benefits, including lightweight, outstanding rigidity, strength, and resistance to corrosion, and fire. Also, it is thermally stable and has excellent dielectric characteristics.\nBased on end-user type - The market is segmented as OE and aftermarket. Out of these, OE is expected to dominate the market for aircraft floor panels over the forecast period. The plan to increase the production rates of existing aircraft programs to support the rebounding demand and new aircraft programs (COMAC C919 and Boeing's B777x) are the main factors contributing to its supremacy. It is anticipated that both, the OE and aftermarket, segments will experience significant growth rates in the coming years.\nTo know the attractive segments, click here for a free sample pdf:\nhttps://www.stratviewresearch.com/Request-Sample/188/aerospace-floor-panel-market.html#form\nWhich Region Offers the Best Opportunity and Growth?\nThe report suggests that North America is expected to remain the largest market for aircraft floor panels over the forecast period.
