Earlier this month, Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, removed one of the final hurdles blocking Sweden from joining Nato by submitting a bill approving membership to parliament for ratification. The move was in line with a commitment Erdo\u011fan made to Nato at its summit in July when he said he would send the bill to parliament for ratification when parliament restarted in October. The Turkish leader has previously demanded that Sweden tighten up on the extradition of Kurdish asylum seekers living in Sweden. Turkish officials have also previously said the steps Sweden had taken to clamp down on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party militia were insufficient.\nUpdated at 16.33 CET", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Russia will succeed in Ukraine unless American support continues, warns US defence secretary - as it happened", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/oct/31/russia-ukraine-war-live-biden-officials-to-make-case-for-ukraine-funding-russia-bulks-up-forces-around-bakhmut-says-kyiv"}
