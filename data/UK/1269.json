She said: \u201cIf this program exists and existed, where were the tests conducted, at what testing grounds? Obviously, apparently not in the region, then where? And isn't the United States behind all this?\u201d\nIsrael Defense Forces target Hamas outpost in Gaza\nBecome an Express Premium member Support fearless journalism\nSupport fearless journalism Read The Daily Express online, advert free\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free Get super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial", "source_domain": "www.express.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Kremlin slams Israeli minister's threat to drop nuke on Gaza and urges urgent intervention", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1832366/russia-israel-gaza-strip-nuclear-weapons"}
