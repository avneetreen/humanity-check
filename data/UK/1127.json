'Exit the building towards the courtyard and surrender,' the soldier ordered, according to a journalist trapped inside.\nAbout 1,000 male Palestinians, their hands above their heads, were soon led into the vast hospital courtyard, some of them stripped naked by Israeli soldiers checking them for weapons or explosives, the journalist told AFP.\nIsraeli soldiers and tanks had surrounded the hospital in recent days, where the IDF and US have insisted Hamas are hiding in underground tunnels beneath the building and using the patients as human shields - claims the terrorists deny.\nBut the storming of the hospital is a key moment in the war and will show once and for all whether Hamas terrorists have indeed based their secret headquarters underneath the hospital while using the most vulnerable civilians as human shields.\nThe move to enter the sprawling hospital by Israeli forces could see civilians, patients and doctors in the middle of the fierce battles, prompting the UN to say it was 'appalled' by Israel's decision to raid the medical facility.\nIsraeli soldiers inside a military vehicle are seen on their way to storm the Al Shifa hospital in this picture released by the IDF\nIsraeli soldiers with rifles storm the Al Shifa hospital and are pictured here within the complex on Wednesday\nThis handout picture released by the Israeli army on Thursday shows soldiers during a military operation around at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City involving tanks\nFootage released by the IDF this morning shows dozens of tanks rolling down the streets towards the hospital\nFootage shows Israeli tanks parked outside hospital and scores of Israeli soldiers storming building\nThe IDF said Israeli troops delivered medical supplies to the Al Shifa hospital as pictured here\nAt Al-Shifa, doctors said patients and people taking shelter were stranded in horrific conditions in the facility\nIsraeli soldiers take part in an operation amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, at a location given as Al-Shati, Gaza, on Tuesday\nThe Al-Shifa hospital, which the World Health Organisation has said is turning into a 'cemetery', has been a primary target for Israeli troops in their battle to seize control of the northern half of the Gaza Strip. Medics and the hundreds of civilians trapped inside have told how newborn babies and patients are dying for lack of fuel.\nNow, Israeli tanks have rolled into the medical compound while scores of soldiers and commandos stormed buildings including the emergency and surgery departments, which house intensive care units, as patients screamed in terror, medics trapped inside said.\nFootage released by the IDF this morning shows dozens of tanks rolling down the streets towards the hospital and scores of soldiers emerging from the vehicles before they entered the building. Israel claimed other video showed soldiers delivering medical supplies to the hospital.\nAs Israeli forces raced through the corridors, hundreds of young men emerged from different wards, including the maternity section, which was hit in a strike a few days ago, a journalist trapped inside reported.\nSoldiers were firing warning shots as they moved from room to room looking for Hamas terrorists, he said, adding that the troops were also searching women and children, some of whom were in tears.\nAfter sharp warnings from the US and others that Al-Shifa must be protected, Israel said the raid was being executed based on 'an operational necessity'.\nTheir aim will be to enter the 300 mile network of tunnels the IDF and US intelligence say are underneath the hospital to annihilate the terrorists who rampaged through Israel and slaughtered 1,200 Israelis. They will also be searching for some of the 240 people who were taken hostage by Hamas on October 7.\nBut that is no easy task. Subterranean fighting is notoriously lethal work, especially when Israeli soldiers are fighting against heavily armed Hamas terrorists who know every hiding place and have access to a stash of rockets, grenades and guns.\nThe terrorists have operated within the complex network of reinforced tunnels underneath civilian buildings for years, some of which are buried up to 40ft underground and all of which could conceal an ambush, be booby-trapped - or worse - filled with explosives and primed to cave in.\nThis means the Israeli military will have to draw on a variety of technology and weaponry - like 'killer' drones, attack dogs and 'sponge' bombs - to help their soldiers 'destroy' the terrorists deep within the tunnels.\nThis is a key moment in the war after weeks of conflicting claims about what lies underneath Al Shifa hospital, where hundreds of patients, including newborns, have been stranded with dwindling supplies and no electricity.\nMohammed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in Gaza, said the patients who are trapped inside the medical facility are terrified after they saw the heavily armed soldiers storm the hospital in the early hours of this morning.\n'They are screaming, it's a very terrifying situation. We can do nothing but pray,' Zaquot said.\nMeanwhile, in a sign of how bleak the situation is in the hospital, the head of the WHO said it had lost touch with health personnel trapped inside after Israeli soldiers began raiding the facility.\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: 'We've lost touch again with health personnel at the hospital. We're extremely worried for their and their patients' safety.\nIn separate comments, U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths said on Wednesday he was 'appalled' by reports of the raids.\n'The protection of newborns, patients, medical staff and all civilians must override all other concerns,' he wrote on X. 'Hospitals are not battlegrounds.'\nGriffiths stressed in a separate video statement that he understood Israel wanted to find Hamas leaders, but insisted that was no excuse for turning hospitals into a battlefield.\n'Hamas must not, should not, use a place like a hospital as a shield for their presence,' he said.\nAs the Israeli soldiers launched their raid of the hospital, they killed several Hamas terrorists during intense battles, the IDF said.\nPalestinians injured in Israeli raids arrive at Nasser Medical Hospital on Tuesday\nThe US statement comes as pressure ramps up on Israel over its blockade of the sprawling Al-Shifa compound, where doctors say patients and people seeking shelter are stranded in horrific conditions\nAn Israeli military armoured vehicle operates amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, at a location given as Al-Shati, Gaza, in this still image taken from video released on Tuesday\nIsraeli soldiers operate, amid the ongoing ground operation of the Israeli army against Hamas, in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday\nIsraeli soldiers operate, amid the ongoing ground operation of the Israeli army against Hamas, in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday\nInjured Palestinian people sit in front of a destroyed building, belonging to Abu Jazar family, following the Israeli attacks in Rafah, Gaza, on Wednesday\nAn injured Palestinian man looks at an injured child lying on a gurney at the hospital following the Israeli bombardment of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip on Wednesday\n'Before entering the hospital our forces were confronted by explosive devices and terrorist squads, fighting ensued in which the terrorists were killed,' the Israeli military said, without specifying exactly where the firefight took place.\nIsraeli Army Radio said five terrorists had been killed and that weapons were found inside the Al Shifa compound.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Dr. Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the health ministry for the Hamas-led administration in Gaza, told Al Jazeera television that Israeli forces had raided the western side of the medical complex and believed an explosion occurred inside the hospital.\nThe surgery and emergency departments were raided first, Zaqout told the broadcaster.\nYoussef Abu Rish, an official from the Hamas-run health ministry who was in the hospital, said he could see tanks inside the complex and 'dozens of soldiers and commandos inside the emergency and reception buildings'.\nDr Ahmed El Mohallalati, a surgeon, told Reuters by phone that staff were in hiding as the fighting unfolded outside the hospital overnight.\n'So yesterday early evening it started... shooting around the hospital and within the hospital. And the sound was really horrible. Look, you can feel that it's, you know, it's very near to the hospital,' he said.\n'And then we realized that the tanks are moving around the hospital. One of the big tanks entered within the hospital from the eastern main gate, and they were, they were they just parked in the front of the hospital emergency department.'\n'All kinds of weapons were used around the hospital. They targeted the hospital directly. We try to avoid being near the windows,' he said.\nAnother witness inside the hospital, reached by telephone, said tanks had entered the compound at 3:00 a.m. The Israeli troops dismounted and spread out in the yard, and began searching the basement and entering buildings.\n'It was very dangerous looking from the glass window. The administration of the hospital told us the occupation army informed them they wanted to search us and search room by room. I am very scared,' the man said, asking that his name be withheld for fear of Israeli reprisals.\n'There was no shooting because there were no gunmen inside the facility. The soldiers were acting freely as were people inside the hospital, the doctors, the wounded and the displaced,' the man said. He later told Reuters that gunfire could occasionally be heard and he was remaining in hiding.\nIsrael says Hamas has a massive command centre inside and beneath Al Shifa, but has not provided visual evidence, while Hamas and the hospital staff have repeatedly denied the allegations.\nThe United Nations has said it estimates that at least 2,300 people - patients, staff and displaced civilians - are inside and may be unable to escape because of fierce fighting.\nWitnesses have described conditions inside the hospital as horrific, with medical procedures taking place without anaesthetic, families with scant food or water living in corridors and the stench of decomposing corpses filling the air.\nA Palestinian woman covered in dust rushes with her child in her arms into the hospital following the Israeli bombardment of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip on Wednesday\nSmoke rises during an Israeli military bombardment of the northern Gaza Strip on Wednesday\nPalestinians survey the destruction following the Israeli bombardment of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip on Wednesday\nSmoke rises from Gaza following an explosion, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, as seen from southern Israel on Wednesday\nIsraeli soldiers take part in an operation amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, at a location given as Al-Shati, Gaza, in this still image taken from video released on Tuesday\nA tank manoeuvres amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, as seen from southern Israel on Wednesday\nIsraeli army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner told CNN the hospital and compound were for Hamas 'a central hub of their operations, perhaps even the beating heart and maybe even a centre of gravity.'\nHours before the raid, the United States said it had its own intelligence suggesting Hamas used Al Shifa and other hospitals, and tunnels beneath them, to support military operations and hold hostages.\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that Hamas and Islamic Jihad 'operate a command and control node from Al-Shifa in Gaza City'.\n'They have stored weapons there and they're prepared to respond to an Israeli military operation against that facility,' he added, citing US intelligence sources.\nIn recent weeks, Israeli defence forces have 'publicly warned time and again that Hamas' continued military use of the Al-Shifa Hospital jeopardies its protected status under international law,' the military said.\n'Yesterday, the IDF conveyed to the relevant authorities in Gaza once again that all military activities within the hospital must cease within 12 hours. Unfortunately, it did not.\n'The IDF has also facilitated wide-scale evacuations of the hospital and maintained regular dialogue with hospital authorities. We call upon all Hamas terrorists present in the hospital to surrender.'\nHamas and hospital staff have denied the Israeli accusations that it uses the hospital for cover. Military officials gave no further details but said they were taking steps to avoid harm to civilians.\nThis comes after pressure ramped up on Israel over the blockade of the sprawling Al-Shifa compound. Doctors said patients and people seeking shelter have been stranded in horrific conditions.\nHamas-run Palestinian authorities called for a ceasefire yesterday to evacuate three dozen newborns and other patients trapped inside Gaza's biggest hospital as Israeli forces battled Hamas in the streets just outside and seized more ground across northern Gaza.\nThe United Nations estimates that at least 2,300 people - patients, staff and displaced civilians - are inside the hospital and may be unable to escape because of fierce fighting from the facility where supplies are nearly exhausted.\nSupplies in the hospital are dwindling and there is no electricity to run incubators and other life-saving equipment. With refrigeration out for days, morgue staff dug a mass grave in the yard for more than 120 bodies yesterday, officials said.\nAt Al-Shifa, doctors said patients and people taking shelter were stranded in horrific conditions in the facility.\n'There are bodies littered in the hospital complex and there is no longer electricity at the morgues,' said Al-Shifa hospital director Mohammad Abu Salmiya, adding that 179 bodies had been interred so far.\n'We were forced to bury them in a mass grave,' he said, adding that seven babies and 29 intensive care patients were among those who had died after fuel for the hospital's generator ran out.\nA witness said the stench of decomposing bodies was everywhere in the Gaza City facility as bombardment and gunfire echoed constantly in the area.\nThe health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says Israel's relentless assault has killed 11,320 people, also mostly civilians, including thousands of children.\nAl-Shifa's fate has become a major focus of the more than five week war, which started after the deadly Hamas of October 7, which killed an estimated 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and saw 240 hostages being taken to Gaza.\nThe United Nations estimates that at least 2,300 people - patients, staff and displaced civilians - are inside and may be unable to escape because of fierce fighting from the facility where supplies are nearly exhausted\nThe Israeli army has encircled Al-Shifa hospital because it believes Hamas is hiding inside and underneath the facility, using civilians as shields for their main command base\nSupplies in the hospital are dwindling and there is no electricity to run incubators and other life-saving equipment.

But Israel's critics point to the toll of a blockade and near-relentless bombing campaign on long-suffering civilians in Gaza.\nThe standoff at Shifa and other hospitals comes as Israeli forces control larger swaths of Gaza City and the surrounding northern part of the Gaza Strip, saying they are driving out and killing Hamas fighters.\nIsrael's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said in a nationally televised press conference last night that Hamas has 'lost control' of northern Gaza and that Israel has made significant gains in Gaza City.\nBut asked about the timeframe for the war, Gallant said: 'We're talking about long months, not a day or two.'\nIsrael has vowed to crush Hamas rule in Gaza after the militants' October 7 attack into Israel, but even as its troops control more of a devastated north Gaza, the Israeli government has acknowledged it doesn't know what it will do with the territory after Hamas' defeat.\nThe onslaught - one of the most intense bombardments so far this century - has been disastrous for Gaza's 2.3 million Palestinians.\nMore than 11,200 people, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah.\nThe health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says Israel's relentless assault has killed 11,320 people, also mostly civilians, including thousands of children\nA witness said the stench of decomposing bodies was everywhere in the Gaza City facility as bombardment and gunfire echoed constantly in the area\nPremature babies under treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit of Al-Shifa hospital were removed from the incubators and transferred to another department in the hospital\nIsrael insists it must protect citizens after the worst attack in the country's 75-year history.

The ministry's count does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths.\nAlmost the entire population of Gaza has squeezed into the southern two-thirds of the tiny territory, where conditions have been deteriorating even as bombardment there continues.\nAbout 200,000 fled the north in recent days, the U.N. said Tuesday, but tens of thousands are believed to remain.\nHamas released a video late Monday showing one of the hostages, 19-year-old Noa Marciano, before and after she was killed in what Hamas said was an Israeli strike. The military later declared her a fallen soldier, without identifying a cause of death.\nShe is the first hostage confirmed to have died in captivity. Four were released by Hamas and a fifth was rescued by Israeli forces.\nFighting has raged for days around Shifa Hospital, a complex several city blocks across at the center of Gaza City that has now 'turned into a cemetery,' its director said in a statement.\nThe Health Ministry said 40 patients, including three babies, have died since Shifa's emergency generator ran out of fuel Saturday. Another 36 babies are at risk of dying because there is no power for incubators, according to the ministry.\nThe Israeli military previously said it had started an effort to transfer incubators to Shifa. But they would be useless without electricity, said Christian Lindmeier, a World Health Organisation spokesman.\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry had proposed evacuating the hospital with the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross and transferring the patients to hospitals in Egypt, but has not received any response, ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said.\nWhile Israel had said it is willing to allow staff and patients to evacuate, some Palestinians who have made it out say Israeli forces have fired at evacuees.\nDenying the claims, the Gaza Health Ministry said it has invited international organizations to investigate the facility.\nThe onslaught - one of the most intense bombardments so far this century - has been disastrous for Gaza's 2.3 million Palestinians\nMore than 11,200 people, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah.

Details of the Israeli account and the extent of Hamas losses could not be independently confirmed.\nOne Israeli commander in Gaza, identified only as Lt. Col. Gilad, said in a video that his forces near Shifa Hospital had seized government buildings, schools and residential buildings where they found weapons and eliminated fighters.\nThe army said it had captured Gaza's legislature building, the Hamas police headquarters and a compound housing Hamas' military intelligence headquarters. The captured buildings carry high symbolic value, but their strategic value was unclear. Hamas fighters are believed to be positioned in underground bunkers.\nIsraeli news sites showed pictures of soldiers holding up the Israeli flag and military flags in celebration inside some of the buildings.\nIsrael has urged civilians in the north to flee south, but southern Gaza is not much safer. Israel carries out frequent airstrikes throughout Gaza, hitting what it says are militant targets but often killing women and children.\nSome 1.5 million Palestinians, more than two thirds of Gaza's population, have fled their homes. U.N.-run shelters in the south are severely overcrowded.\nPeople stand in line for hours for scarce bread and brackish water. Trash is piling up, sewage is flooding the streets and taps run dry because there is no way to power water systems. Israel has barred fuel imports since the start of the war, saying Hamas would use it for military purposes.\nAt a tent camp outside a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, people trudged through mud as they stretched plastic tarps over flimsy tents.\n'All of these tents collapsed because of the rain,' said Iqbal Abu Saud, who had fled Gaza City with 30 of her relatives. 'How many days will we have to deal with this?'\nThe U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which is struggling to provide basic services to over 600,000 people sheltering in schools and other facilities in the south, said it may run out of fuel by Wednesday, forcing it to halt most aid operations, including bringing limited supplies of food and medicine in from Egypt.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Israeli soldiers storm Al-Shifa hospital as they bid to prove once and for all Hamas terrorists HAVE hidden a base beneath the building and used Gaza's most vulnerable citizens as human shields", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12749281/Israel-Hamas-battle-outside-Shifa-hospital-terrorist-gunmen-sheltering.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"}
