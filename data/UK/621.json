Hamas called the claim \u201cfalse and baseless\u201d.\nMeanwhile, the group issued fresh demands for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails to be released and threatened the lives of the hostages it holds if they were not.\nIsrael believes Hamas is still holding about 137 hostages, while there are thought to be 7,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons, many detained without charge. Family members of the hostages protested at the Knesset on Monday after being refused admission to a meeting the foreign affairs and defence committee held with Netanyahu, where they sought to keep pressure on the prime minister to keep the lives of hostages central to his decisions.\nQatari officials, who helped broker a humanitarian pause last month to allow the exchange of hostages for Palestinians prisoners, said there were few immediate prospects of a repeat of such a deal. The Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said Israel\u2019s relentless bombardment was \u201cnarrowing the window\u201d for a potential agreement.\nThe spread of the ground offensive to the south of Gaza, accompanied by heavy bombing, has created an untenable situation for the population, humanitarian organisations have said. The death toll so far is estimated at more than 18,200 and more than 1.8 million people, or about 80% of the population, have been forced from their homes since the conflict broke out on 7 October. It was triggered by an attack by Hamas gunmen who broke through the Gaza border and went on a rampage through Israel villages, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.\nIsrael has said 104 members of its forces have been killed in Gaza since the ground operation began on 27 October, and 582 soldiers have been injured.\nThe UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said 1.3 million of the displaced people in Gaza were sheltering in 154 of its facilities, which were heavily overcrowded. Aid officials have warned that cholera and pneumonia are an increasing threat among the dense camps of improvised tents along Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt, as sanitation breaks down and nighttime temperatures dip.\nThe head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: \u201cGaza\u2019s health system is on its knees and collapsing.\u201d\nIn face of the catastrophic humanitarian situation, Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, accused Israel over the weekend of \u201ca systematic effort to empty Gaza of its people\u201d.\nThe head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, has said that \u201cthe developments we are witnessing point to attempts to move Palestinians into Egypt\u201d. He wrote in the Los Angeles Times: \u201cIf this path continues, Gaza will not be a land for Palestinians any more.\u201d\nEylon Levy, an Israeli government spokesman, rejected suggestions Israel intended to empty Gaza of Palestinians as \u201coutrageous and false accusations\u201d, arguing that the aim was only to persuade Palestinians to leave the principal combat areas.\nThe UN and other agencies, however, have said the impact of the offensive has been to make the whole of Gaza uninhabitable and to cripple the humanitarian effort.\nView image in fullscreen Smoke rises after Israeli strikes in Khan Younis. Photograph: Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/Reuters\nThe Biden administration faced severe criticism from Arab allies and human rights organisations over the weekend for its sole vote at the UN security council against a ceasefire resolution, blocking it with the US veto.\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said the security council\u2019s \u201cauthority and credibility were severely undermined\u201d by the failure of the resolution.\nThe matter will pass to the UN general assembly, in a debate on Tuesday on a similar resolution, most likely to be followed by a vote. A resolution passed by the assembly has no binding authority in international law, but it is expected to underline the increasing isolation of Israel and the US in their efforts to fend off a ceasefire.\nThe US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Sunday restated the US\u2019s argument against a ceasefire. \u201cWith Hamas still alive, still intact and \u2026 with the stated intent of repeating 7 October again and again and again, that would simply perpetuate the problem,\u201d he told ABC News.\nBlinken said Israeli forces should ensure \u201cmilitary operations are designed around civilian protection\u201d, but admitted they had fallen short. \u201cI think the intent is there. But the results are not always manifesting themselves,\u201d he said.\nThe Biden administration has faced intensified scrutiny after it revealed it had bypassed Congress to supply tank shells, and was reported not to be carrying out continual assessments of whether Israel was committing possible war crimes.\nThe Washington Post cited unnamed officials as admitting the US was not following guidelines Biden established in February for all arms transfers to foreign governments to be subjected to continual examination of the recipient\u2019s record on the Geneva conventions and other global norms for conducting warfare.\nView image in fullscreen The UN\u2019s Ant\u00f3nio Guterres speaking in Qatar. Photograph: Reuters\nIt was widely reported in the Israeli press on Monday that the US has been trying to persuade Israel to wrap up its Gaza offensive by the end of this month, while the IDF had asked for more time, until the end of January, to achieve the stated war aims, to destroy Hamas as a military and political force and secure the release of the hostages.\nBlinken said the issue of the duration of the war had been raised in US-Israeli discussions, but told CNN: \u201cThese are decisions for Israel to make.\u201d\nIsrael\u2019s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, said there was no deadline for Israel to achieve the twin goals of dismantling Hamas and rescuing the remaining hostages. \u201cThe evaluation that this can\u2019t be measured in weeks is correct, and I\u2019m not sure it can be measured in months,\u201d he told Channel 12.\nNetanyahu criticised countries including France and Germany that have called for a ceasefire: \u201cYou cannot on the one hand support the elimination of Hamas, and on the other pressure us to end the war, which would prevent the elimination of Hamas.\u201d\nItaly, France and Germany called on the EU to impose sanctions on Hamas and its supporters in a joint letter to the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, on Monday. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, said France was also considering imposing sanctions on Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank.\n\u201cWe will work on proposing sanctions on extremist settlers in the West Bank,\u201d Borrell told reporters in Brussels on Monday.\nIn Israel\u2019s north, violence escalated at the border with Lebanon on Sunday as Hezbollah launched explosive drones and missiles at Israeli positions and Israeli airstrikes rocked several towns and villages in south Lebanon. The IDF said on Monday it had carried out air strikes on southern Lebanon in response to missile launches aimed at communities in the northern Galilee area.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel rejects claims it is trying to force Palestinians out of Gaza", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/11/israel-hamas-war-idf-khan-younis-gaza-hostages-threats"}
