P\u00e9rez Salas served as head of security for Guzman and his brothers, who are collectively known as the \u201cChapitos.\u201d\nSoldiers caught Guzman but later were ordered to release him to avoid bloodshed.\nIn order to pressure the army to release Guzman, cartel gunmen had surrounded the army families' housing complex in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa, and sprayed it with gunfire. They took one soldier hostage, burst into four apartments looking for more potential hostages, and tossed in two hand grenades that failed to explode.\nThe army had apparently relied on an unwritten rule that soldiers' wives and children were not to be targeted. \u201cIt was an area that was not even guarded,\u201d Sandoval said.\nIn January, when soldiers finally managed to detain Ovidio Guzman, P\u00e9rez Salas also allegedly participated in setting off violence that left 30 people dead, including 10 military personnel.\nThe army was forced to use Black Hawk helicopter gunships against the cartel\u2019s truck-mounted .50-caliber machine guns. Cartel gunmen hit two military aircraft, forcing them to land, and sent gunmen to the city\u2019s airport, where military and civilian aircraft were hit by gunfire.\nSandoval revealed Friday that there had been a special operation that day to get P\u00e9rez Salas, but it failed.\nThe army continued to follow his movements, and later tried to detain him a second time, but \u201che was able to escape,\u201d Sandoval said.\nThe third time was a charm; video posted on social media showed that P\u00e9rez Salas was surrounded but managed to climb onto the roof of a house before he was caught Wednesday.\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration had posted a $3 million reward for the capture of P\u00e9rez Salas, though it was unclear if that will be distributed to the army and National Guard forces that caught him this week.\nPresident Joe Biden issued a statement Thursday praising the arrest. U.S. prosecutors have asked that P\u00e9rez Salas be extradited \u2014 as his boss Ovidio Guzman was in September \u2014 to face U.S. drug charges.\n\u201cThese arrests are testament to the commitment between the United States and Mexico to secure our communities against violence, counter the cartels, and end the scourge of illicit fentanyl that is hurting so many families,\u201d Biden wrote.\nBut it appears P\u00e9rez Salas's arrest was personal for the Mexican army.\n\u201cHe was also responsible for a series of attacks against military personnel that caused a significant number of casualties,\u201d Sandoval said.\nP\u00e9rez Salas is wanted on U.S. charges of conspiracy to import and distribute fentanyl in the United States. But he also allegedly left a trail of killings and torture of police and civilians.\nAn indictment in the Southern District of New York says P\u00e9rez Salas allegedly participated in the torture of a Mexican federal agent in 2017. It said he and others tortured the man for two hours, inserting a corkscrew into his muscles, ripping it out and placing hot chiles in the wounds.\nAccording to the indictment, the Ninis \u2014 the gang of gunmen led by P\u00e9rez Salas and Jorge Figueroa Benitez \u2014 carried out other gruesome acts of violence as well.\nThe Ninis would take captured rivals to ranches owned by the Chapitos for execution, it said.\n\u201cWhile many of these victims were shot, others were fed, dead or alive, to tigers\u201d belonging to the Chapitos, \u201cwho raised and kept tigers as pets,\u201d according to the indictment.\nAnd while the Sinaloa cartel does some lab testing on its products, the Ninis conducted more grisly human testing on kidnapped rivals or addicts who are injected until they overdosed.\n____\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Mexico's arrest of cartel security boss who attacked army families' complex was likely personal", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-sinaloa-cartel-mexico-city-mexico-culiacan-b2453070.html"}
