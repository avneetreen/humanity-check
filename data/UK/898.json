They must not be overfed.\u2019\nUpon their arrival, each returning hostage will be assigned to a designated soldier, ensuring personalised care and support.\nSpecialised training has been imparted to soldiers, especially in cases involving children, aimed at providing reassurance and companionship throughout the reintegration process.\nThe initial phase post-arrival involves medical screening and reception, and soldiers have also been told not to inform if they are asked if they know anything about loved ones \u2018even if they know they are dead\u2019.\nIsrael's tanks and military vehicles are seen driving out of Gaza on Friday morning\nPalestinians are seen driving away from their temporary shelters this morning\nPalestinians who had taken refuge in temporary shelters return to their homes in Khan Yunis\nMark Regev, a senior advisor to Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told CNN on Thursday night they were trying to stay positive about the release of the hostages.\n'Like [US President Joe] Biden, I think Israelis are keeping their fingers crossed that this will, in fact, happen, and we'll see 13 Israelis returned tomorrow,' he said.\n'That's our hope. But we have to wait and see. We know who we're dealing with. Hamas is a brutal, ruthless terrorist organization and we have to be ready for things that are unexpected.'\nAlong with the release of some of the hostages comes a halt in fighting, which promised some relief for Gaza's 2.3million people, who have endured weeks of Israeli bombardment, as well as families in Israel fearful for the fate of loved ones taken captive.\nSmoke was rising over Gaza as the deadline passed, and CNN's correspondent in the Israeli town of Sderot, on the border with Gaza, heard booms coming from the enclave and what he said was the sound of artillery fire. Air raid sirens were also heard in Sderot, CNN reported, although it was unclear whether missiles were fired.\n'We are hearing the sounds of war,' said Jeremy Diamond in the minutes after the ceasefire deadline passed. 'And we are not supposed to be hearing that after the truce.'\nHe reported that after the first 20 minutes of tension, the noise subsided and the truce appeared to be in place.\nThe ceasefire was agreed for 7am local time on Friday, and Israel immediately issued a statement urging Palestinians in Gaza not to return to their homes in the north.\nAvichay Adraee, the IDF spokesman for Arab media, said: 'The war is not over yet. The humanitarian pause is temporary. The northern Gaza Strip is a dangerous war zone and it is forbidden to move north.\n'For your safety, you must remain in the humanitarian zone in the south. It is only possible to move from the north of the Strip to the south via Salah al-Din Road.

Regev said he could not discuss the delay.\nThe hostages are from many countries - the majority Israeli and Thai, but with around ten from the United States and others from the UK, Spain, France, Germany, Argentina, the Netherlands and beyond.\nPalestinian officials have provided a list of 300 people they want releasing - most from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Jerusalem, and held for incidents such as attempted stabbings, hurling stones at Israeli soldiers, making explosives, damaging property and having contacts with hostile organizations. None are accused of murder.\nMany were held under administrative detention, meaning they were held without trial.\nThe released prisoners could be taken by buses to the presidential headquarters of the Palestinian Authority first as in past releases, Reuters reported - even though Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas had no role in these truce negotiations, a Palestinian official said.\nThose involved in the deal have described the break in hostilities 'a humanitarian pause'.\nThe pause will be extended by a day for each additional batch of ten hostages released, Israel said in a statement.\nHamas said Israel had agreed to halt air traffic over the north of Gaza from 10am until 4pm each day of the truce and to halt all air traffic over the south for the entire period.\nFamilies of hostages and their supporters demanded that Israeli prime minister BenNetanyahu secures the release of Israeli hostages.
