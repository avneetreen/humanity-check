Hagari, in his regular briefing on Friday, said: We are determined to advance our operation. It will happen wherever Hamas exists, including in the south of the strip. It will happen at the time, place and conditions that are best for the military. The IDF spokesperson\u2019s comments come amid mounting concerns about Israeli plans to expand military operations in parts of the south where people have sought refuge from fighting. Civilians in parts of south-east Gaza have been told in leaflets dropped by Israeli aircraft to move into a smaller \u201csafe zone\u201d in the coastal town of Mawasi, which covers just 14 sq km (5.4 sq miles).\n18 Nov 2023 05.46 CET The director of the al-Wafa hospital in Gaza City was killed and several doctors were injured in an Israeli airstrike launched against the hospital overnight on Friday, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa.

The first delivery arrived from Egypt late on Friday as Israel pressed its offensive, combing the Gaza Strip\u2019s largest hospital, al-Shifa, for the Hamas operations centre it says lies beneath. Israel\u2019s war cabinet unanimously agreed on Friday to allow two fuel tankers a day \u201cto run the wastewater treatment facilities ... which are facing collapse due to the lack of electricity\u201d, national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said.

Under the deal, 140,000 litres (37,000 gallons) of fuel will be allowed in every 48 hours, of which 20,000 litres will be earmarked for generators to restore the phone network, a US official said. Communications have been down for two days after fuel ran out, and a first consignment of about 17,000 litres was earmarked for telecommunications company Paltel. The communications blackout hampered aid deliveries, UNRWA said.\n18 Nov 2023 03.52 CET Israeli attack in Khan Yunis kills 26 \u2013 Palestinian report About 26 Palestinians, mostly children, were killed in an Israeli bombardment of the city of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza early on Saturday, Reuters reports the Palestinian news agency Wafa as saying.\n18 Nov 2023 03.26 CET A group of pro-Palestinian protesters forced their way into a building on a University of Michigan campus in the US, police said.

Agence France-Presse reports that Griffiths also said: We are not asking for the moon.

Israel\u2019s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, said on Friday that Israel\u2019s war cabinet had agreed to allow the \u201cvery minimal\u201d amount of fuel to enter for Gaza\u2019s communications system and water and sewage services. The White House said later on X (formerly Twitter) that it was \u201cglad Israel agreed to fuel deliveries to Gaza at our strong request\u201d. We believe these deliveries should continue on a regular basis and in larger quantities. We are glad Israel agreed to fuel deliveries to Gaza at our strong request.

The warning in the latest indication that the Israeli military plans to attack Hamas in southern Gaza after subduing the north. Mark Regev, an aide to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told MSNBC on Friday: We\u2019re asking people to relocate. I know it\u2019s not easy for many of them, but we don\u2019t want to see civilians caught up in the crossfire. Such a move could compel hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled south from the Israeli assault on Gaza City to relocate again, along with residents of the southern city of Khan Younis, worsening a dire humanitarian crisis.
