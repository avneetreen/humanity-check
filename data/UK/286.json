Photograph: Mohamed Azakir/Reuters\nNasrallah\u2019s comments on Friday were, however, more forceful than those made earlier this week, and came as Lebanon issued a formal complaint to the UN security council over Arouri\u2019s killing, and over Israeli incursions into Lebanon\u2019s airspace to attack targets in Syria.\nIn what appeared to be an effort to talk up Hezbollah\u2019s carefully calibrated campaign since the beginning of the war in Gaza, where 22,000 people have been killed, the Hezbollah chief said his group had been engaged in a war with Israel for more than 90 days in which it had hit a large \u201cnumber of targets\u201d.\nHe added that Hezbollah had launched 670 attacks on Israel in the past three months at an average rate of between six and seven daily.\n\u201cFor those who demand to know why we are fighting on the [southern] front, we are obliged to reply. There are two goals on this front: to pressure the enemy and its government to cease the aggression against Gaza. The second goal is to relieve the pressure on the resistance [Hamas] in Gaza.\u201d\nThe veteran Hezbollah leader\u2019s comments \u2013 broadcast nationally \u2013 were directed at a gathering at a mosque in Baalbek in Bekaa valley in Lebanon, who had gathered to commemorate one of the founders of Hezbollah, Muhammad Hassan Yaghi.\nAs clerics and Hezbollah MPs arrived for the address, most unwilling to comment on the current febrile situation, others at the mosque said they believed Israel had crossed a \u201cred line\u201d.\n\u201cBecause of the situation we have to make sacrifices,\u201d said Zoulfikar Zaiter. \u201cThe situation is not clear. We have neither peace nor war right now. The situation cannot continue like this. We are waiting now for Nasrallah to say whether there will be peace or war. I am certain it is not going to stay the same.\u201d\nOthers, however, suggested that Nasrallah and Hezbollah were likely to maintain the ambiguous position that they have held for the last three months.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will go to a major war,\u201d said Ahmed, 40, who declined to give a family name. \u201cIt\u2019s hard now for the people in the south,\u201d he added. About 76,000 in the area have been displaced by the border exchanges. Tens of thousands have also been forced to leave their homes on the Israeli side of the border.\n\u201cBut because they have faith they will have to bear the sacrifice. It is clear who is responsible for this. It is Israel.\u201d\nNasrallah\u2019s speeches have been closely watched throughout the Middle East and beyond as the Israel Defense Forces and Hezbollah have traded daily fire on the border since 8 October, the day after Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel.\nNasrallah and Hezbollah have so far pursued a more pragmatic policy of containing the violence to limited exchanges close to the border, refraining from using Hezbollah\u2019s arsenal of heavier rockets. But the killing of Arouri in one of Hezbollah\u2019s most significant strongholds has changed the calculus.\nNasrallah has previously made much of maintaining a policy of an \u201cequilibrium of deterrence\u201d between Hezbollah and Israel, which analysts view as having been dangerously undermined by Tuesday\u2019s assassination on Hezbollah\u2019s doorstep.\nThat has led many to speculate that Hezbollah will itself need to escalate its response but within a spectrum that falls short of triggering a full-scale war.\nIn the midst of a long-running and debilitating economic crisis in Lebanon, Hezbollah has held back from a broader offensive, while Israel has not claimed responsibility for killing Arouri, despite off-the-record comments by US officials that Israel was behind the assassination.\nThe Israeli government has been pushing for Hezbollah to withdraw from the border area.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Hezbollah chief says response to killing of senior Hamas official is \u2018inevitable\u2019", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/05/hezbollah-chief-says-response-to-killing-of-hamas-no-2-is-inevitable"}
