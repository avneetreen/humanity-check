But I don't have more on casualty numbers or anything else to read out,' Singh told reporters, using an acronym for Iran's Revolutionary Guards.\nThe American strike Sunday is the third since October 26 as the United States attempts to quell wave after wave of drone and rocket attacks against American troops in Syria and Iraq, triggered by the Israel-Hamas war.\nTwo weeks earlier, the US sent two F-16 fighter jets to attack a weapons storage facility and an ammunition plant near Abu Kamal.\nBoth sites were run by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Pentagon said.\nOn November 8, the US also carried out a retaliation airstrike on a weapons warehouse in Maysulun, allegedly used by Iranian forces and their proxy militias.\nDefense officials said the strikes were not directly connected to the Israel-Hamas war, but analysts said they were designed to send a warning to Iran not to take advantage of the regional turmoil to widen the conflict.\nIran's Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said at the United Nations last week that if Israel's offensive against Hamas does not end, the United States will 'not be spared from this fire'.\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi (center) and Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad (right) are seen Saturday during a bilateral meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Iran-backed forces established a foothold in Syria while fighting in support of Assad during the country's civil war\nBiden has warned Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei not to attack US forces in the region, and said there would be consequences.\n'My warning to the Ayatollah was that if they continue to move against those troops, we will respond,' said Biden.\nSince the Israel-Hamas conflict erupted, the United States has deployed additional air defenses and sent warships and fighter aircraft to the region, including two aircraft carrier groups, to try to deter Iran and its proxy forces.\nHamas on October 7 launched an unprecedented sneak attack on Israel that left 1,400 dead, most of them civilians.\nIsrael has responded by pummeling the Gaza strip with airstrikes, and launching a ground assault on the Palestinian enclave in an attempt to remove Hamas from power there.\nGaza's Hamas-controlled health ministry, which does not differentiate between combatant and civilian casualties, says more than 11,000 Palestinians have died in the war.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Video shows Biden's retaliation airstrikes on Iranian proxy forces in Syria - as Pentagon reveals 59 Americans have been injured in recent drone and missile attacks in the region", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12752793/Biden-Syria-airstrike-Hamas-Israel.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"}
