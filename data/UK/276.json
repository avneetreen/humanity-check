But in Gaza the situation was much more challenging, he said\n\u201cIt will take a year to dismantle Hamas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not the six-day war [of 1967]. The timeline is long \u2026 [IS strongholds] Mosul and Raqqa were not fortified underground \u2026 and the coalition was 85 countries.\u201d\nYadlin also compared the current Israeli offensive to that launched by the IDF into the West Bank in 2002 after a wave of suicide bombings by Palestinian militant groups.\n\u201cIn 2002 it took two months to get into Palestinian cities and two years to make the terror stop. So Israel is looking at nine months to a year [in Gaza]. It depends on how long Hamas will hold [on],\u201d he said.\nThe new timeline will concern international observers worried about regional instability and aid agencies who have described a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.\nView image in fullscreen A displaced Palestinian child plays in Rafah near the border with Egypt. Photograph: Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/Reuters\nThere are widespread fears that clashes along Israel\u2019s northern border between its military and Hezbollah could escalate into all-out war, possibly plunging the region into a wider conflict.\nBenjamin Netanyahu has said the war will not end until the aims of \u201ccrushing\u201d Hamas, freeing Israeli hostages and ensuring that Gaza poses no further security threat to Israel are met.\n\u201cI say this to both our enemies and our friends. This is our responsibility and this is our commitment,\u201d Israel\u2019s prime minister told his cabinet on Sunday.\nNetanyahu faces a difficult meeting this week with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who is on a week-long Middle East tour. Washington\u2019s top diplomat is expected to demand Israel does more to protect civilians in Gaza, allows more aid to reach the territory and offers more detailed proposals for the governance of the territory when Israel\u2019s military offensive ends.\nIsrael\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, suggested last week that unspecified Palestinian bodies \u2013 apparently local civil servants or community leaders \u2013 would take over the territory\u2019s governance.\nGallant also indicated a more precise approach to targeting Hamas fighters and their leaders to reduce civilian casualties.\nYadlin, however, said the IDF\u2019s southern command, which has responsibility for Gaza, had started planning buffer zones within the territory that would be heavily mined to prevent any repeat of the 7 October attack. Such a move would be controversial.\nIsrael\u2019s campaign in Gaza has killed more than 22,400 people, more than two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the territory. Thousands more are thought to be buried under rubble and tens of thousands wounded.\nThe offensive was launched after Hamas sent thousands of militants into southern Israel, where they killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted about 240 others.\nIsrael blames Hamas for the civilian casualties in Gaza, accusing the group of using residents as a \u201chuman shield\u201d and says it has killed 8,000 \u201cterrorists\u201d.\nAn airstrike near the southern city of Rafah killed two journalists on Sunday, including Hamza Dahdouh, the oldest son of Wael Dahdouh, Al Jazeera\u2019s well-known chief correspondent in Gaza, the Arabic channel and local medical officials said. Al Jazeera broadcast footage of Dahdouh, weeping and holding his son\u2019s hand, before walking away in a daze.\n00:01:18 Two journalists killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Gaza \u2013 video report\nDahdouh previously lost his wife, two children and a grandchild in a 26 October airstrike, and he was wounded himself in an Israeli strike last month that killed a co-worker.\nHagari said on Saturday that the IDF\u2019s campaign would use \u201ca different method\u201d in the centre and south of Gaza.\n\u201cWe apply the lessons we have learned and continue to develop more creative and cunning ways to fight in space \u2013 to kill terrorists, destroy terrorist infrastructures, and means of warfare above and below the ground,\u201d he told reporters.\nThe war in Gaza has also led to an increase in violence in the occupied West Bank, where nine people were killed on Sunday, including seven Palestinians, in an Israeli airstrike on the northern city of Jenin, according to Palestinian authorities.\nThe IDF said \u201csix terrorists were killed when an aircraft struck a terrorist who hurled explosive devices\u201d at troops in an operation in Jenin refugee camp.\nPolice said an Israeli officer had also been killed during an operation at the refugee camp when a vehicle struck a homemade bomb. An Israeli civilian was shot dead in another incident elsewhere, the army said.\nThere are still 139 hostages being held in Gaza, including civilians and military personnel, though some are thought to have been killed during the fighting. Thousands of people protested in Tel Aviv on Saturday, calling on the Israeli government to prioritise their release.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel says Gaza fighting could last a year, amplifying fears of regional war", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/07/israel-says-gaza-fighting-could-last-a-year-amplifying-fears-of-regional-war"}
