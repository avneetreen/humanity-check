Pictured Navy SEALs on a mission\nJohn Kirby, the spokesman for the National Security Council, told CBS News Sunday that they're working on disrupting Iranian shipments of weapons to the Houthis but are not related to the American airstrikes targeting the militant group's facilities\nBesides the defense of ships from launched drones and missiles shot from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, the US military has also come to the aid of commercial ships that have been the targets of piracy.\nIn a statement Saturday, US Central Command said that search and rescue operations are currently ongoing to locate the two sailors.\nThe command said it would not release additional information on the Thursday night incident until the personnel recovery mission is complete.\nThe sailors were forward-deployed to the US 5th Fleet area of operations supporting a wide variety of missions.\nWhile not connected, the mission does coincide as the US has unleashed a new wave of strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.\nThe blitz on Friday came a day after initial strikes against over 60 targets used by the Iranian-backed rebels to attack ships in waters near the Arabian Peninsula.\nThe second round of bombing was much smaller in scale and targeted a Houthi radar facility, an official confirmed. It came after the Houthis fired at least one anti-ship missile earlier the same day.\nBiden had vowed to continue the bombardment if the Houthis refused to cease attacking vessels in the Red Sea.\nBut in New York City protests erupted after demonstrators swarmed First Avenue near the United Nations Yemen Mission to condemn the attack.\nThe US deployed a new round of strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on Friday, targeting a radar facility\nShortly after protesters descended on the United Nations Yemen Mission in New York to condemn the strike\nThe raid on the radar facility came after the Houthis launched an anti-ship ballistic missile in retaliation for the overnight strikes by US and British forces on Thursday\nThe latest round of strikes were smaller in scale than the initial wave seen on Thursday. Protesters gathered to demand an end to all strikes.\nThe official confirmed the latest strikes were conducted unilaterally by the US.\nHowever, the Houthi-run al-Masirah TV station claimed that the US and the UK had been involved in the strikes on the Yemeni capital of Sanaa.\nUK Ministry of Defence sources said any suggestions of UK involvement in the second round of strikes against the Houthis were inaccurate. A formal statement confirming the UK's non-involvement is expected later today.\nA source said: 'There was no UK participation in these strikes \u2013 it was a unilateral action carried out by the US.'\nBut Thursday's blitz, a response to attacks on cargo ships by Houthis in the Red Sea, was a cooperative effort between the US, UK and other allied nations.\nThe assault struck more than 60 targets, killing five people and wounding six more, a spokesman for the Houthi military told CNN.\nBut US officials determined the additional location, a radar site, still presented a threat to maritime traffic, one official said.\nPresident Joe Biden said on Friday that the American airstrikes against the Houthi in Yemen were a success, adding that he's delivered a message to Iran with them.\n'I don't think there's any civilian casualties \u2014 that's another reason why it's a success,' Biden told reporters traveling with him in Pennsylvania.\nThe White House has said the airstrikes in Yemen, most of which is controlled by the Houthis, were in retaliation for months of attacks by the movement on Red Sea shipping that the rebels cat as a response to the ongoing war in Gaza.\nHowever their targets have become increasingly random and caused disruption to global shipping channels.\nWhen asked if he has a message for Iran, Biden said: 'I've already delivered the message to Iran.'\nThe president also noted Tehran 'doesn't want a war with us,' but said he is willing to bomb the Houthi again if they keep striking at American troops.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "REVEALED: Two Navy SEALs lost at sea off the coast of Somalia went missing when one slipped on a ladder while boarding a ship that was taking Iranian weapons to Houthi rebels in Yemen", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12963283/Navy-SEALs-lost-Houthi-weapons-ship-Iran-Yemen.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"}
