The U.S. ship was not damaged in the incident.\nThe U.S. has in recent weeks shot down several drones headed toward Israel that were launched from Yemen, and in Sunday's attack, the Pentagon said it responded to a distress call from the Unity Explorer, which said it was under attack from missile fire.\nA Houthi military spokesperson, Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, claimed the attacks, saying the rebels hit one vessel with a missile and another with a drone while in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that links the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden.\n'The Yemeni armed forces continue to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea [and Gulf of Aden] until the Israeli aggression against our steadfast brothers in the Gaza Strip stops,' Saree said. 'The Yemeni armed forces renew their warning to all Israeli ships or those associated with Israelis that they will become a legitimate target if they violate what is stated in this statement.'\nSaree also identified the first vessel hit as the Unity Explorer, which is owned by a British firm that includes Dan David Ungar, who lives in Israel, as one of its officers. The Houthi spokesperson said the second hit was a Panamanian-flagged container ship called Number 9, which is linked to Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement.\nIsraeli media have identified Ungar as being the son of Israeli shipping billionaire Abraham (Rami) Ungar.\nFor more than a month, Iranian-backed militias have conducted drone and rocket attacks against the 2,500 American troops based in Iraq and the 900 troops in Syria.", "source_domain": "www.britainnews.net", "text": null, "title": "Houthi Insurgents Attack US Warship, Commercial Vessels in Red Sea", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.britainnews.net/news/274053564/houthi-insurgents-attack-us-warship-commercial-vessels-in-red-sea"}
