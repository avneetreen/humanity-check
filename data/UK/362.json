But that\u2019s what happened when a September profile of Hasan Minhaj in the New Yorker called out the former host of the Netflix series Patriot Act for misrepresenting his truth in two Netflix standup specials. In one, Minhaj described a white FBI informant infiltrating his mosque and an anthrax scare involving his young daughter (neither happened as Minhaj described them, the magazine found). In another, he recalled a white high school crush who jilted him on prom night for seemingly no other reason than his being of Indian descent (she denied it went down like that). The magazine said Minhaj\u2019s stories \u201cblur the lines between entertainment and opinion journalism\u201d, triggering an intense public debate about whether the comedian had stooped to claiming race-based victimhood to advance his career. Bill Maher likened Minhaj, a peer, to Jussie Smollett.\nIn a 21-minute video rebuttal, Minhaj made a case for punching up his biography while poking holes in the New Yorker\u2019s hallowed vetting process. \u201cWith everything that\u2019s happening in the world,\u201d Minhaj intoned, \u201cI\u2019m aware even talking about this now feels so trivial. But being accused of faking racism is not trivial. It is very serious, and it demands an explanation.\u201d\nHis staunch defense did the job of rallying his fans back onto his side, but not in time to undo the damage. Minhaj, a clear frontrunner to replace Trevor Noah as The Daily Show\u2019s permanent host, was reportedly dropped from contention in what looked for all the world like punishment for using creative license in a creative medium. \u201cIt\u2019s so bizarre to me,\u201d says the Last Comic Standing finalist Laurie Kilmartin. \u201cBecause when you look at how modern standup started, it was a thing that happened in between strippers. It\u2019s gutter art. We\u2019re not trying to win a Pulitzer prize.\u201d\nIt used to be that comedians were the ones holding the powerful and persuasive to account, at no time more so than when Jon Stewart factchecked the Bush administration and its enablers in the mainstream media from behind The Daily Show desk. But as conventional wisdom of the past has given way to the age of bespoke truths, The Daily Show and other comedy institutions are no longer society\u2019s only funny factcheckers. Ever since standup comedy, a longtime fixture of clubs and late-night TV, achieved mainstream ubiquity, individual comics are doing that job too. And yet standup comedians balk at the prospect of that sobering treatment being turned on their own work.\nView image in fullscreen Hasan Minhaj performs at the 13th Annual Stand Up for Heroes Benefit in New York, November 2019.

Certainly, more people streamed that special than Jada Pinkett Smith\u2019s docudrama on Cleopatra, released the same month. Fact-based film and TV projects have themselves been checked against the official record since time immemorial; Pinkett Smith\u2019s decision to cast a Black actor as Cleopatra raised hackles in Egypt, with academics arguing the queen probably looked more like Elizabeth Taylor. Even music lyrics are taken as articles of fact that can potentially be used in court, as we\u2019re seeing with Young Thug\u2019s racketeering trial in Georgia. There\u2019s little doubt that much of the curiosity for Rock\u2019s special stemmed from a factchecking impulse to square his first-hand experience with third-hand perspectives of the slap seen \u2019round the world.\nWhen the world was turned upside down by Covid and the racial reckoning, Dave Chappelle emerged as the man who could make sense of it all. After the 2020 Netflix special 8:46, named for the time it took for Derek Chauvin to kill George Floyd, Chappelle was widely celebrated for putting laughs aside and speaking to the heart of the tragedy. It was only after pivoting to making transphobic jokes in 2021\u2019s The Closer special \u2013 a theme Chappelle returned to again on stage this year after promising to back off (and figures to touch on again in a year-end special) \u2013 that the top comic has been taken more seriously as a spreader of misinformation.\n\u201cChappelle is by far the lying-est comedian,\u201d said Jesse David Fox, a comedy journalist at Vulture, citing the 2017 special The Age of Spin. In it, Chappelle argues for not throwing away the \u201cvaluable legacy\u201d Bill Cosby left in spite of his history of alleged sexual abuses and, by way of example, notes how Cosby paid for the public address (PA) system for the 1963 March on Washington \u2013 a fact that\u2019s easily disproved. \u201cBecause he\u2019s raised so much gravitas,\u201d says Fox of Chapelle, \u201che just gets away with it.\u201d\nThat gravitas comes from the new \u201cexpectation for comedians [to be] up there with public intellectual people\u201d, says Fox, who also wrote 2023\u2019s How Comedy Conquered Culture \u2013 and the Magic That Makes It Work. \u201cThey\u2019re not just held to the same standard as a famous director. They\u2019re held to the same standard as [the ABC evening news anchor] David Muir.\u201d\nIn 2023, there was little circumventing the demand for truth in comedy. A year after raising hackles for featuring Chappelle at an Ohio show, John Mulaney drew scrutiny again for a bit in his Baby J special about hawking his $12,000 Rolex for half the price to buy drugs \u2013 a story Vulture went to lengths to confirm. In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Mulaney copped to omitting the saddest part of that anecdote: that he accidentally dumped $3,000 of the $6,000 he made from selling the Rolex in the trash. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell that story of, you know, \u2018And there I was, selling a watch I had just bought, and I felt so small,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have that tone, you know? I really wanted to present these stories almost as if I was proud of them.\u201d\nView image in fullscreen Dave Chappelle performs at Madison Square Garden in August. Photograph: Eduardo Mu\u00f1oz/Reuters\nLike Minhaj, Mulaney builds connection with his audience through \u201cemotional truths\u201d, as Minhaj described 70% of his comedic style to the New Yorker (the other 30% he called \u201chyperbole, exaggeration, fiction\u201d). But the veteran standup Kevin McCaffrey cautions: \u201cThere\u2019s a difference in lying for the laugh and lying for the clap.\u201d\nWhere Mulaney aims to please, this year\u2019s most controversial young comic, Matt Rife (you may know him from TikTok \u2013 or his cheekbones), takes factchecks as fighting words. In his 2023 Netflix special Natural Selection, Rife needled women who turn to astrology for help choosing mates. \u201cJust because Jupiter has a ring and you don\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean you should run to the planets for magical relationship advice,\u201d he cracked. The influencer Bunny Hedaya reacted to the clip by posting a video of her six-year-old son offering a humble correction: \u201cActually, it\u2019s Saturn that has the rings.\u201d\nInstead of taking pushback good-naturedly, the 28-year-old Wild \u2019n Out regular allegedly unloaded on the kid in the comments, slagging off his mother for buying \u201cpresents with the money she makes on OnlyFans\u201d. (Hedaya does not appear to have a presence on that platform, whereas Rife has an account and a debut special named Only Fans.) For too many observers, the exchange seemed about on par for a comic who had apologized for a domestic violence joke in his special by directing the offended to a website for special needs helmets, a gambit that Rife\u2019s bedrock of women fans heard as a breakup line. Lost in the exchange between Rife and Hedaya\u2019s son was the fact that both were right: Saturn and Jupiter each have rings. \u201cThe star comedians are just the most amazing level of sensitive babies now,\u201d McCaffrey said.\nThis wasn\u2019t just a year that saw Rob Schneider rail against wokeism in an \u201cunfiltered\u201d comedy special to a friendly Fox Nation crowd. It was the year Joe Rogan opened an \u201canti-cancel culture\u201d comedy club in Austin, Texas, expressly to remain unchecked. \u201cI\u2019m drunk and high on mushrooms,\u201d he enthused on opening night. \u201cYou can\u2019t fire me from my own club, bitch!\u201d\nIn one clip from his dreaded Christmas Day special for Netflix, Armageddon, Ricky Gervais does the extra work to delineate fact from fiction in a sick punchline that has him calling Make-a-Wish kids \u201cretarded\u201d.\n\u201cThese are all jokes,\u201d he disclaims. \u201cI don\u2019t even use that word in real life, the r-word.\u201d It goes to show how swiftly standup comedy has evolved from resenting the masses for not taking a joke to resenting them for taking a joke as gospel.\nMinhaj\u2019s work makes it especially tough on audiences to suspend disbelief. Where a more traditional standup might paint a picture in a listener\u2019s mind with little more than a mic in hand, Minhaj drew on compelling visual aids. The FBI informant bit was underscored by Al Jazeera footage of an actual informant. In interviews with a New Yorker staff writer, Clare Malone, Minhaj admitted his story never happened \u2013 to which some say, so what?\nView image in fullscreen Matt Rife on The Kelly Clarkson Show this year. Photograph: NBC/Weiss Eubanks/NBCUniversal/Getty Images\n\u201cThat he experienced racism and Islamophobia matters more than whether it happened exactly as he said it,\u201d said Kilmartin, who judges her peers far more harshly for being actual hypocrites. \u201cWhen Louis CK was positioning himself as the ultimate cool feminist when in real life he wasn\u2019t, that\u2019s when you lose your audience. You can\u2019t be that different from your stage persona. But at the same time, if somebody\u2019s talking about a perceived experience, you have to give them some latitude. If you\u2019re trying to get laughs from a male audience talking about sexism or a white audience talking about racism, you have to change things a bit or they won\u2019t participate. They\u2019ll get defensive.\u201d\nFor the prom bit, Minhaj deployed immersive staging to set the scene, including a screengrab of what looks like the blurred-out faces of his would-be prom date with her now husband \u2013 \u201cIndian as fuck,\u201d he vented, pointing out the irony. Minhaj also closely collaborated with factcheckers on Patriot Act, an extra step that made his material seem that much more airtight. Just as affecting was Minhaj\u2019s use of similarly high production value in his rebuttal video. The whole spiel had the feel of a Daily Show production, with Minhaj at a desk as a series of supposedly exculpatory graphics and audio recordings flashed over his shoulder. (The New Yorker stands by its story.)\nBut in the end he would be forced to admit that much of his standup was embellished for dramatic effect. (He later revealed that actors played the real people shown in the onstage screengrab.) Minhaj told the magazine about his routines: \u201cThe emotional truth is first. The factual truth is secondary.\u201d\n\u201cIt does seem like that interview with him was done in \u2026 I don\u2019t want to say in bad faith,\u201d McCaffrey said. \u201cBut it does feel like there was an agenda, for sure. I think Hasan is paying a price for being a person that people believed did give a shit about what was real.\u201d\nThat a magazine factcheck would ultimately cost Minhaj a job doing the fake news is an irony that will surely make its way into a future Minhaj Netflix special. He was already drawing on the experience during a recent appearance at New York\u2019s Beacon Theater. After relaying a story about a girl cheating on him in high school, Minhaj warned the audience: \u201cDon\u2019t factcheck me.\u201d\n\u201cI had to go head-to-head with one of the most dangerous organizations in the world,\u201d he said, ruling out the US military or the Israeli Defense Forces. \u201cI am talking about a white woman with a keyboard.\u201d But in the new era of the standup intellectual, many audiences will see Minhaj\u2019s warning less as a challenge than as a call of duty.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018Lying for the laugh\u2019: should comedians tell us the truth?", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/27/standup-comedy-demands-hasan-minhaj-truth-lying"}
