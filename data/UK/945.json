It meant a dearth of information for a population desperate to know where to obtain food, fuel and clean water, he said.\n\u201cReporting the conflict has become so much more dangerous because of the exponential risk to local Palestinian journalists who are on the frontline and have no safe haven and no way out,\u201d Mansour said.\n\u201cAlso the Israeli army has refused to take any responsibility for the killings, saying to the international media organisations that they cannot guarantee the safety of the media or their employees.\n\u201cWe have said, especially after the army targeted communications facilities, that we have reached a news blackout. We also have the problems with censorship, assaults and detentions in the West Bank.\u201d\nNinety percent of the journalists killed have been Palestinians, with the exception of four Israeli reporters killed in the Hamas attacks, and one Lebanese citizen. The majority of the Palestinians killed have been freelancers and photo-journalists.\n\u201cThey are the most needed right now but they are also the most vulnerable,\u201d said Mansour.\nAnother nine journalists have been injured and a further three are missing. Thirteen have been arrested as part of what is described as an Israeli \u201ccensorship regime\u201d introduced under emergency legislation making it an offence to damage \u201cnational morale\u201d or \u201cnational security\u201d.\nIt is unclear how many journalists were covering the conflict at the times of their deaths. But the CPJ is investigating each instance to see if reporters were caught in the crossfire while trying to do their jobs, Mansour added.\nThe grim tally has prompted the committee to renew calls initially made before the outbreak of the latest hostilities for Israel to reform its rules of engagement so that clearly identified journalists are protected.\n\u201cLast May, we said the IDF must change their rules of engagement to stop unleashing the use of lethal forces against journalists and media organisations,\u201d said Mansour, who cited a previous CPJ report, Deadly Pattern, which said 13 out 20 journalists killed in Gaza before the current war had been wearing or carrying press markings at the time.\n\u201cWe have not seen any indication that this has been done. This time, therefore, we have also called on Israel\u2019s allies, including the United States, Britain and other European countries to pressure it to stop any use of lethal force against journalists.\u201d\nThe call for protective measures follows claims this month by an Israeli media advocacy group, HonestReporting, that some international media outlets knew about Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack in advance, citing the publication of pictures taken by local journalists showing the group storming into Israeli territory.\nHonestReporting subsequently withdrew the accusations in the face of the organisations\u2019 denials but not before the office of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, issued a statement calling journalists who had photographed the event accomplices in \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d. Benny Gantz, a member of the Israeli war cabinet, said they should be treated as terrorists and hunted down.\nDays after the report, the home of Yasser Qudih, a freelance photographer who provided pictures of the Hamas attack to Reuters, was struck by four missiles. Qudih survived the strike but eight members of his family were killed. It is unclear whether Israel launched the strike.\nMansour called the HonestReporting claim a \u201csmear campaign\u201d that put Palestinian journalists\u2019 lives in danger and said it was consistent with previous \u201cfalse narratives\u201d implying that Palestinian reporters were involved in terrorist activity.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take hours or a genius in Gaza to know about Israeli army operations or Hamas operations,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are talking about a 20-mile-long strip that is six miles wide. There are so many ways journalists could be at the scene \u2013 it doesn\u2019t take any inside knowledge to open the window and look at the sky and see where the operation is.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel-Hamas war is deadliest conflict on record for reporters, says watchdog", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/21/israel-hamas-war-is-deadliest-conflict-on-record-for-reporters-says-watchdog"}
