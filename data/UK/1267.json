The air echoed with the pounding of air strikes, the thud of mortars and the chattering of heavy-calibre machine guns.\nAll the munitions \u2013 an extraordinary volume of them \u2013 were targeting a Hamas battalion making what the IDF said was its last stand in a hospital and school in the northern town of Beit Hanoun.\n\u201cThey talk the talk, but they don\u2019t walk so good,\u201d said Lieutenant Colonel Blick of the Israeli 551 Reserve Paratroop Battalion, which escorted The Telegraph to the front line on Tuesday.\nPointing to the plumes of dust rising about 2km to the south, Lt Col Blick said fewer than 100 Hamas fighters were taking shelter in the Indonesian Hospital, the last survivors of a thousand-strong unit.\n\u201cThey fought when we came in but folded after a day. Their command lines were cut. Now, where you can see the dust rising, in the hospital, they are making their last stand,\u201d he said.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Hamas terrorists\u2019 last stand at Gaza hospital", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/11/07/hamas-fighters-last-stand-gaza-hospital/"}
