Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, President Emmanuel Macron of France and several Middle East leaders are expected to attend next week\u2019s World Economic Forum, where talks to end wars in Gaza and Ukraine are at the top of the agenda. \u201cIt is a pity that a constructive talk about the situation in Ukraine will not happen \u2013 there will be no Russian delegation,\u201d Deripaska said in a post on the Telegram app, according to Reuters. \u201cDon\u2019t await peace before May 2025.\u201d Deripaska, who is reported to have made his fortune by buying up stakes in aluminium factories, has been sanctioned by Britain for his alleged ties to Vladimir Putin.

We must find ways to work with China on this,\u201d Swiss federal councillor Ignazio Cassis told a news conference after a session of the meeting, Reuters reports. China was not represented at the gathering of national security advisers before the World Economic Forum in Davos. The meeting of more than 80 officials is the fourth such gathering organised by Ukraine, which Cassis said must pave the way to talks between Moscow and Kyiv on ending the war. \u201cA peace for the Ukrainian people is urgently necessary \u2026 We must do everything to end this war,\u201d Cassis said, adding that so far Russia and Ukraine were not willing to make concessions. Cassis said that countries that had a dialogue with Russia, such as Brazil, India and South Africa, were involved in the discussions in Davos and could play an important role. \u201cThe participation of the Brics alliance is very important because these countries have a relationship to Russia \u2026 All this can create this collective movement to bring in countries that are far from the conflict but can play a role in influencing China and Russia,\u201d Cassis said.\nUpdated at 16.21 CET\n14 Jan 2024 14.01 CET Ukrainians are being urged to create drones for the military at home as part of the \u201cPeople\u2019s Drone\u201d project. According to Ukraine\u2019s digital transformation minister Mykhailo Fedorov, the Victory Drones NGO is behind the \u201cPeople\u2019s Drone\u201d project. Participants can take a free engineering course to teach themselves how to assemble a 7-inch FPV (first-person-view) drone at home. The Kyiv Independent reports: FPV drones are cheap to manufacture and can be precisely flown into targets. They have the capability of destroying much more expensive military equipment. The drones are \u201cgame-changers\u201d in the war, according to Fedorov. The course offers Zoom sessions with instructors, a list of components, and must-have tools and materials to purchase to construct an FPV drone, as well as access to a community of engineers who offer advice and answers to any questions. The assembled drone is handed over to Victory Drones instructors for quality tests, and if they pass, they are transferred to the military. \u201cParticipants in the course have already handed over more than 100 drones to the military. Overall, more than 80% of them were submitted to Victory Drones instructors in good working condition, while the rest needed some adjustments. This is a very high success rate for pilot assembly!\u201d Fedorov said.\n14 Jan 2024 13.30 CET The role of the global south in Ukraine\u2019s peace formula talks has come into focus in Davos, where national security advisers were meeting on Sunday. Reuters reports: Many of the non-aligned countries from Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia that have largely stayed on the sidelines over Ukraine will be represented in the Swiss mountain resort this week. Nigeria\u2019s national security adviser Nuhu Ribadu could be seen attending the NSA meeting. Yermak said that there were participants from 18 Asian countries, 12 African countries and 6 South American countries. \u201cCountries from the Global South are increasingly involved in our work,\u201d Yermak said on his Telegram account. Ukraine , with strong backing from its allies, has consistently said it will not give up until it has reclaimed every piece of territory that Russia has taken. It is unclear, however, if countries in the Global South agree with that as a peace formula.\nUpdated at 13.34 CET\n14 Jan 2024 13.05 CET Ukraine presents peace formula to meeting of national security advisers at Davos Ukraine pushed ahead with its peace formula to end nearly two years of war with Russia with a meeting of national security advisers from around the world in Davos on Sunday.

The assistance package, among other things, includes projects for demining agricultural land and reconstructing the dormitory of the Nikolaev State Agrarian University. \u201cDenmark is one of our most committed partners in the recovery process. In the spring of 2023, the country took patronage over Nikolaev and the Nikolaev region. Since then, we have already made progress in restoring the city - most of the projects of previous aid packages have either already been completed or are moving forward successfully,\u201d said Alexander Kubrakov, Minister of Development of Communities, Territories and Infrastructure of Ukraine.

Ukraine wants Australia\u2019s decommissioned Taipan helicopters but they are reportedly being scrapped. In September last year, the Australian Army\u2019s MRH-90 helicopters were retired 14-months earlier than scheduled, after a crash in Queensland killed four defence personnel during a training exercise two months earlier. Ukraine made an official request for the MRH-90\u2019s on December 19, 2023, despite the aircraft\u2019s safety and operational concerns. \u201cOur assessment of risk is different. We\u2019re at war,\u201d Anton Bogdanovych, who helped organise a rally of Ukrainian supporters in Sydney on Sunday, told Australia\u2019s ABC news.

The United States and its allies have previously condemned what they describe as Russia\u2019s firing of North Korean missiles at Ukraine. with Washington calling it abhorrent and Seoul calling Ukraine a test site for Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear-capable missiles. Moscow and Pyongyang have denied conducting any arms deals but vowed last year to deepen military relations. North Korea has stepped up pressure on Seoul in recent weeks, declaring it the \u201cprincipal enemy\u201d, saying the North will never reunite with the South and vowing to enhance its ability to deliver a nuclear strike on the U.S. and America\u2019s allies in the Pacific. Pyongyang\u2019s isolated government is forging closer ties with Moscow. Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui will visit Russia from Monday to Wednesday at the invitation of her counterpart Sergei Lavrov, the North\u2019s KCNA news agency said on Sunday. \u201cPyongyang*s show of force should be of concern beyond Seoul, as its military cooperation with Moscow adds to the violence in Ukraine , and because it may be more willing to challenge the U.S. and its allies while global attention is fixed on the Middle East,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, an international studies professor at Ewha Womans University, Reuters reports. The U.S. State Department on Thursday imposed sanctions on three Russian entities and one individual involved in the transfer and testing of North Korea\u2019s ballistic missiles for Russia\u2019s use against Ukraine.\n14 Jan 2024 10.25 CET Russian shelling of Kherson injures at least six, say Ukraine officials Russian shelling of Kherson has injured at least six residents, according to reports by local and national officials.

Republicans in both chambers of Congress had demanded stricter border regulations in exchange for their support, and they said the bill failed to meet their requirements. Ahead of the 6 December vote, Biden had delivered an address to urge Congress to pass the bill, warning that a failure to act would only benefit Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president.\nUpdated at 10.22 CET\n14 Jan 2024 09.37 CET A former mayor of the Russian city of Vladivostok has enlisted to fight in Ukraine and departed for the front after he was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption, the Kommersant newspaper reported on Sunday, citing his lawyer.
