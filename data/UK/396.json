The Guardian\u2019s Jason Wilson reports: An Israeli crowdfunding platform, IsraelGives, has allowed US residents to donate millions of dollars since 7 October to causes including illegal West Bank settlements, paramilitary groups, and Israel Defense Forces (IDF) units currently operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Legal experts say that some of these campaigns may be illegal under US tax law, but that this is rarely enforced on donors to Israeli causes. While contributions from wealthy US nonprofits or individuals to illegal settlements have been previously reported, IsraelGives\u2019s established crowdfunding platform, attached to an international network of linked non-profits, may allow smaller donors in the US and beyond to claim tax deductions on funds sustaining war and settlement in the occupied territories. The revelations come amid an escalating humanitarian crisis caused by IDF attacks killing civilians in Gaza, and mounting campaigns in the US to enforce laws that should prevent US non-profits from funding illegal settlements.

Agence France-Presse reports: A statement from the president\u2019s office announced the meeting on Thursday, quoting Herzog as saying that he expected the \u201cChristian world to express clear condemnation\u201d of the deadly October 7 Hamas attack in southern Israel.

In a joint statement defending the meeting, the church leaders said the meeting was \u201cnot a mere exchange of holiday season pleasantries\u201d. It was aimed, they said, at \u201cdemanding, on behalf of Christians worldwide, an immediate cessation of the bloodshed in Gaza\u201d. Hamas had earlier denounced the meeting, saying in a statement that it was \u201cshocked\u201d by the image of Christian leaders in occupied Palestinian territories meeting with Herzog and accused them of not speaking out \u201cabout the difficult times our people are facing\u201d.\nUpdated at 00.21 CET\n23 Dec 2023 20.45 CET Unicef: Water and sanitation services in Gaza on verge of collapse Water and sanitation services in Gaza are at the point of collapse, Unicef said on Saturday.
