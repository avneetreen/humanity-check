Prompts for \u201cIsraeli boy\u201d generated cartoons of children playing soccer and reading. In response to a prompt for \u201cIsrael army\u201d the AI created drawings of soldiers smiling and praying, no guns involved.\nMeta\u2019s own employees have reported and escalated the issue internally, a person with knowledge of the discussions said.\nView image in fullscreen An AI generated sticker in WhatsApp shows an image of a boy with a gun when asked for pictures of \u2018Muslim boy Palestinian\u2019. Photograph: Whatsapp\nMeta-owned WhatsApp allows users to try out its AI image generator to \u201ccreate a sticker\u201d. The feature prompts users to \u201cturn ideas into stickers with AI\u201d. Guardian searches for \u201cMuslim Palestine\u201d, for instance, surfaced four images of a woman in a hijab: standing still, reading, holding a flower and holding up a sign. But Guardian searches for \u201cMuslim boy Palestinian\u201d at 4.46pm ET on Thursday generated four images of children: one boy is holding an AK-47-like firearm and wearing a hat commonly worn by Muslim men and boys called a kufi or taqiyah.\nAnother Guardian search for \u201cPalestine\u201d one minute earlier generated an image of a hand holding a gun. Prompted with \u201cIsrael\u201d the feature returned the Israeli flag and a man dancing. The prompt of \u201cHamas\u201d brought up the message \u201cCouldn\u2019t generate AI stickers. Please try again.\u201d\nOne user shared screenshots of a search for \u201cPalestinian\u201d that resulted in another, different image of a man holding a gun.\nView image in fullscreen An AI generated sticker search in WhatsApp shows an image of a man with a gun when prompted with the search \u2018Palestinian\u2019. Photograph: Whatsapp\nSimilar searches for \u201cIsraeli boy\u201d surfaced four images of children, two of which illustrated boys playing soccer. The other two were just portrayals of their faces. \u201cJewish boy Israeli\u201d also showed four images of boys, two of whom were portrayed wearing necklaces with the Star of David, one wearing a yarmulke and reading and the other just standing up. None of them carried guns.\nEven explicitly militarized prompts such as \u201cIsrael army\u201d or \u201cIsraeli defense forces\u201d did not result in images with guns. The cartoon illustrations portrayed people wearing uniforms in various poses, mostly smiling. One illustration showed a man in uniform holding his hands forward in prayer.\nView image in fullscreen An AI generated sticker search in WhatsApp shows images of three girls when prompted with the search \u2018Israel\u2019. Photograph: Whatsapp\nThe discovery comes as Meta has come under fire from many Instagram and Facebook users who are posting content supportive of Palestinians. As the Israeli bombardment of Gaza continues, users say Meta is enforcing its moderation policies in a biased way, a practice they say amounts to censorship. Users have reported being hidden from other users without explanation and say they have seen a steep drop in engagement with their posts. Meta previously said in a statement that \u201cit is never our intention to suppress a particular community or point of view\u201d, but that due to \u201chigher volumes of content being reported\u201d surrounding the ongoing conflict, \u201ccontent that doesn\u2019t violate our policies may be removed in error\u201d.\nKevin McAlister, a Meta spokesperson, said the company was aware of the issue and addressing it: \u201cAs we said when we launched the feature, the models could return inaccurate or inappropriate outputs as with all generative AI systems. We\u2019ll continue to improve these features as they evolve and more people share their feedback.\u201d\nUsers also documented several instances of Instagram translating \u201cPalestinian\u201d followed by the phrase \u201cPraise be to Allah\u201d in Arabic text to \u201cPalestinian terrorist\u201d. The company apologized for what it described as a \u201cglitch\u201d.\nView image in fullscreen An AI generated sticker search in WhatsApp shows images of four people in uniform in various poses when prompted with the search \u2018Israeli army\u2019. Photograph: Whatsapp\nIn response to the Guardian\u2019s reporting on the AI-generated stickers, the Australian senator Mehreen Faruqi, deputy leader of the Greens party, called on the country\u2019s e-safety commissioner to investigate \u201cthe racist and Islamophobic imagery being produced by Meta\u201d.\n\u201cThe AI imagery of Palestinian children being depicted with guns on WhatsApp is a terrifying insight into the racist and Islamophobic criteria being fed into the algorithm,\u201d Faruqi said in an emailed statement. \u201cHow many more racist \u2018bugs\u2019 need to be exposed before serious action is taken? The damage is already being done. Meta must be held accountable.\u201d\nMeta has repeatedly faced pressure from Palestinian creators, activists and journalists, particularly in times of escalated violence or aggression toward Palestinians living in Gaza and the West Bank. A September 2022 study commissioned by the company found that Facebook and Instagram\u2019s content policies during Israeli attacks on the Gaza strip in May 2021 violated Palestinian human rights. The report said Meta\u2019s actions may have had an \u201cadverse impact \u2026 on the rights of Palestinian users to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, political participation, and non-discrimination, and therefore on the ability of Palestinians to share information and insights about their experiences as they occurred\u201d.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "WhatsApp\u2019s AI shows gun-wielding children when prompted with \u2018Palestine\u2019", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/02/whatsapps-ai-palestine-kids-gun-gaza-bias-israel"}
