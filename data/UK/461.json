Commercial Aircraft is expected to dominate the market in 2022 and is expected to register a higher CAGR, during the forecast period. The increasing production rates of various commercial aircraft are the major factor, which is expected to drive the segment growth. Airbus forecasts a demand for 32,630 single-aisle and 8,220 wide-body aircraft over the next 20 years. similar estimation of over 40,000 commercial and regional aircraft deliveries by Boeing in the next twenty years.\nBased on the application type - The market is classified as avionics, interiors, propulsion systems, airframes, and others. Among all the segments, interior applications are likely to be the key demand generators for wires & cables during the forecast period, owing to the rising penetration of IFECs. Moreover, the avionics segment is expected to record significant growth, during the forecast period, as there will be a larger usage of wires & cables, with the transition to digital avionic systems in modern aircraft. High speed, lighter weight, compactness, and durability of wires & cables are the key requirements for avionics applications.\nBased on the product type - The market is bifurcated into hook-up wires, coaxial cables, data bus cables, power cables, and others. The hook-up wires segment held the largest share of the market in 2022 owing to its widespread usage in aerospace interiors and avionics. Data bus cables aren't far behind and have captured around one-fourth share in 2022. Data bus cables are widely used in avionics, in-flight entertainment, and communication needs. The latter is also expected to record the fastest long-term growth during the forecast period.\nBased on the material type - The market is segmented into PTFE tape, polyimide tape/PTFE tape, polyimide tape/UV laser markable, and others. PTFE tape is expected to remain the dominant material type in the market during the forecast period, as these wires can withstand high power as well as protect cables from fire and heat. PTFE tape also has excellent low dielectric properties, exhibits low-loss factors, has unique resistance to high temperatures, chemical reactions, and corrosion; and FST.\nBased on the purpose type - The market is segmented into general-purpose wires & cables and special-purpose wires & cables. General-purpose wires & cables dominated the market due to the wide-scale requirements for standard aerospace electrification, onboard and ATC communication, and navigation.\nTo know the attractive segments, click here for a free sample pdf:\nhttps://www.stratviewresearch.com/Request-Sample/628/aircraft-wire-and-cable-market.html#form\nWhich Region Offers the Best Opportunity and Growth?\nThe report suggests that North America is likely to take the lead in the market.
