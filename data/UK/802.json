Quite how many is unclear. It is now known that Hamas needed to mobilise auxiliaries such as police into Israel for the attacks that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on 7 October alongside better trained fighters, which suggests that estimates that Hamas has 30,000 or more combat troops are exaggerated.\nBut then Israeli claims that they have killed many thousands of Hamas militants seem high too. Senior Israeli military officers told the Guardian that Hamas casualties include dozens of battlefield commanders \u2013 which is credible \u2013 but that the senior leadership is almost untouched. \u201cRemoving Hamas from Gaza starts with the leadership of Gaza and there is a lot of work to be done,\u201d said Eyal Hulata, a former national security adviser, on Thursday.\nHamas was also capable of firing a dozen successive barrages of rockets into southern Israel within a couple of hours on Friday morning, and many of the tunnels it has built under Gaza remain intact.\nWho is in charge of Hamas?\nIn theory, Hamas is run by a leadership council or \u201cshura\u2019\u201d drawn from regional councils elected by Hamas members in Gaza, the West Bank and by prisoners in Israeli jails. In reality, the organisation is riven by factional disputes and personality clashes.\nOne split divides the military from the political wings. Another pits the leaders in Gaza, who have lived for decades in the crosshairs of Israel\u2019s security agencies or spent years in Israeli jails, against senior figures overseas in Qatar, Turkey, Lebanon or elsewhere who live in relative comfort and security.\nThis is aggravated by personality clashes. Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, is said to be barely on speaking terms with Khaled Mashal, who is the best-known of the organisation\u2019s political leaders and based in Qatar.\nIt is unclear if Sinwar briefed the political leadership in Qatar and Lebanon on the planned 7 October attacks but this is thought unlikely by experts \u2013 adding to the resentment.\nThe relatively pragmatic Ismail Haniyeh, the chair of Hamas\u2019s political bureau, tries to mediate among the factions, though with little success, experts say.\nHaniyeh also has his own job to do. \u201cHaniyeh is leading the political battle for Hamas with Arab governments,\u201d said Adeeb Ziadeh, a specialist in Palestinian affairs at Qatar University. \u201cHe is the political and diplomatic front of Hamas.\u201d\nThe internal disputes complicate this task. In recent weeks, Haniyeh has moved between Turkey and Qatar\u2019s capital, Doha, escaping the travel restrictions of the blockaded Gaza Strip and enabling him to act as a negotiator in the earlier ceasefire deal or talk to Hamas\u2019s main ally, Iran.\nBut the final yes or no comes from Sinwar. When during recent talks Sinwar decided to cut off communications, negotiations stalled. \u201cThis pretty effectively underlined who is calling the shots,\u201d said one European diplomatic source briefed the negotiations.\nIs Hamas still in control in Gaza?\nCivil administration has broken down across all of Gaza, where 15,000 people, 40% of whom were children, were killed in the five weeks of the Israeli offensive, according to local authorities, at least 1.5 million are displaced and huge swaths of urban areas have been reduced to rubble. The Israel Defense Forces has taken over the north of Gaza, where most government offices were, but elsewhere Hamas still appears in charge of the territory it has ruled for 16 years. Hamas was able to locate, gather and return dozens of hostages to Israel, despite some being held by smaller independent factions or criminal clans. It also managed the optics of the release effectively and so scored a major propaganda coup.\nWhat\u2019s happening in the occupied West Bank?\nHamas was already popular in the West Bank, something that most analysts attribute more to the failures of the Palestinian Authority than the Islamist organisation\u2019s ideological appeal. A poll in September suggested that Haniyeh, who left Gaza in 2016, would win in presidential elections against Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, but would lose against a stronger candidate.\nThe violence in Gaza has raised tensions in the West Bank, where nearly 240 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or settlers since 7 October, according to the Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry, and the release of many prisoners from Israeli jails has given Hamas a huge boost. Many residents of Ramallah, a town supposedly a stronghold for the ruling party, Fatah, have expressed their admiration for Hamas. At one rally this month, members of liberal political parties and organisations chanted pro-Hamas chants.\nThe shooting attack in Jerusalem on Thursday claimed by Hamas, which killed three people at a bus stop, may have been a spoiler aimed at derailing any extension to the ceasefire, a threat of what could follow if fighting was renewed, or simply a pressure valve to placate local militants opposed to any deals.\nA Hamas statement after the attack quoting the Qur\u2019an spoke of \u201ca jihad of victory or martyrdom\u201d, language that has been absent recently from Hamas public statements.\nCould there be a new ceasefire?\nThe first phase of this conflict is over, analysts say. The arrangement reached on 24 November, which brought a temporary halt to fighting in Gaza and allowed for women and children held as hostages in the Strip to be freed in exchange for Palestinian women and children held in prison by Israel, cannot be renewed but will have to be replaced by a new deal.\nAny fresh deal would involve the exchange of individuals who are much more valuable, in the brutally cynical language of such negotiations, to both sides. Israel will want freedom for male civilians among the hostages and also the soldiers that Hamas is holding. Hamas will want more senior prisoners released, including some that Israel will absolutely not want to free, and possibly in much greater numbers. Ezaat Al Rashq, a Hamas leader, told Qatar\u2019s Al Araby TV last week: \u201cWe are willing to negotiate over [Israeli] military prisoners but at the right time and the price will be much higher than the price of releasing other hostages.\u201d\nAll negotiations are a test of strength. Between such bitter enemies, with both sides committed to a lengthy conflict and a total absence of trust, this is particularly true. Israeli policymakers believe that military pressure will force Hamas to make concessions. Hamas believes it can turn Israel\u2019s great military strength into a political weakness, losing a battle but winning the war. The tragic reality is that violence is now an extension of negotiations, and the negotiations part of the violence.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "How strong is Hamas and could there be another ceasefire in Gaza?", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/01/israel-palestine-how-strong-is-hamas-another-ceasefire-gaza"}
