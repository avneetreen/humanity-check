The CFE was signed in November 1990 as the Soviet bloc was crumbling but was not fully ratified until two years later.\nNATO said that Tuesday's action by its signatory members was required because \u201ca situation whereby Allied State Parties abide by the Treaty, while Russia does not, would be unsustainable.\u201d\nEarlier in the day, Moscow said it had finalized its withdrawal from the treaty. The long-expected move came after both houses of the Russian parliament approved a bill proposed by President Vladimir Putin denouncing the CFE.\nU.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said suspending the obligations by Washington and its allies will strengthen NATO's \u201cdeterrence and defense capacity by removing restrictions that impact planning, deployments, and exercises -\u2013 restrictions that no longer bind Russia after Moscow\u2019s withdrawal.\u201d\nRussia's actions \u201cfurther demonstrates Moscow\u2019s continued disregard for arms control,\u201d he added.\nThe German Foreign Ministry underscored that Berlin and its allies are not pulling out of the treaty. \u201cIn the case of a fundamental change in Russia\u2019s behavior, a renewed implementation of the CFE remains possible,\u201d it said.\nThe ministry said Germany intends to stick to the national limits for weapons systems in the treaty. It criticized Moscow\u2019s withdrawal, saying that \u201cRussia is destroying another pillar of our European security and arms control architecture.\u201d\n\u201cSecuring a balanced conventional potential of forces in Europe cannot be realized without the involvement of Russia,\" it added.\nThe treaty was one of a number of major arms control treaties involving Russia and the U.S. that has been crippled in recent years.\nIn February, with U.S.-Russia tensions running high over Ukraine, Moscow suspended its participation in the New START Treaty, the last arms control pact that remains between the two countries.\nBoth countries also pulled out of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019, blaming each other for violations.\nThe INF Treaty, which was signed by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, banned the production, testing and deployment of land-based cruise and ballistic missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,410 miles).\nWilliam Alberque, director of Strategy, Technology and Arms Control at The International Institute for Strategic Studies, expressed concern that another arms control treaty is under threat.\n\u201cWhat is needed right now is more transparency, more risk reduction, more what we would call guardrails on competition,\" he said. \u201cWe basically need to manage the competition so that it doesn\u2019t spiral into crippling arms races.\u201d\nWhen it was signed, the CFE envisaged weapons limits for the Warsaw Pact and NATO, but the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist shortly after it was signed. Unsuccessful attempts were made to renegotiate its conditions.\nRussia suspended its participation in 2007, and in 2015 announced its intention to completely withdraw.\nIn February 2022, Putin sent hundreds of thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine, which also shares borders with NATO members that signed the CFE: Poland, Romania and Hungary.\nAnnouncing Moscow's withdrawal from the treaty had been completed, the Russian Foreign Ministry blamed the U.S. and its allies for the move as well as the West\u2019s allegedly \u201cdestructive position\u201d on the treaty.\n\u201cWe left the door open for a dialogue on ways to restore the viability of conventional arms control in Europe,\u201d it said. \u201cHowever, our opponents did not take advantage of this opportunity.\u201d\nThe ministry said that \u201ceven the formal preservation\u201d of the treaty has become \u201cunacceptable from the point of view of Russia\u2019s fundamental security interests,\u201d citing developments in Ukraine and NATO\u2019s recent expansion.\nNATO said its members remain committed \u201cto reduce military risk, and prevent misperceptions and conflicts.\u201d It said the alliance will continue to \u201cconsult on and assess the implications of the current security environment and its impact on the security\" of the Euro-Atlantic region.\n___\nMorris reported from Tallinn, Estonia.
