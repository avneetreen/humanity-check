So when Hamas launched its brutal attack on 7 October, the Biden administration immediately offered Israel strong political and military support. Two and a half months into the bloody war in Gaza, the situation has changed significantly. The scale of death and destruction in the strip has meant that global support for Israel has weakened. This week the UN general assembly called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza after a resounding vote in which 153 member states out of 193 supported the resolution.\nThe US was one of only 10 countries that voted against the resolution \u2013 even the UK and Germany, who have been supporting Israel throughout the war, abstained, making Biden an increasingly lonely figure on the world stage.\nHowever, reports of rising tensions between Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, and president Biden have become increasingly common. The pair are said to be at odds over the handling of the conflict, which has left at least 18,000 people dead, with some estimates indicating that up to 70% of the fatalities have been women and children.\nI spoke with the Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, about the fracturing relationship between the two states and how it could affect the way Israel prosecutes the war. That\u2019s right after the headlines.\nFive big stories\nIsrael-Gaza war | Heavy winter rains have lashed Gaza, washing out tents and flooding some areas, as the head of the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees described deteriorating conditions in the coastal strip as a \u201cliving hell\u201d. Amid escalating shortages of food, spreading waves of communicable disease and the near collapse of Gaza\u2019s health system, the winter storm turned large areas to mud. US politics | The House voted Wednesday to formally authorise the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, even as Republicans have failed to produce evidence showing that the president financially benefited from his family\u2019s business dealings. Economy | Financial markets are betting the Bank of England will be forced to launch a deep round of interest rate cuts in 2024 amid the growing risk of a recession. UK news | A 16-year-old boy accused of killing Brianna Ghey has described freezing as, he claimed, he saw his female co-defendant stab the teenager with his knife in a Warrington park. Education | Under new proposals by the government\u2019s campus free speech tsar, university staff and students can make provocative statements on subjects such as Israel and Gaza as long as they do not break laws on incitement or harassment. Universities and colleges in England that infringed the rights to expression of individuals could face fines under the new complaints process.\nIn depth: \u2018Biden and his administration are getting more and more uneasy\u2019\nView image in fullscreen US ambassador alternate representative of the US for special political affairs in the United Nations, Robert A Wood, raises his hand during a UN security council meeting on Gaza, at UN headquarters in New York City on 8 December 2023. Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images\nThe UN vote has reinforced the idea that \u201cthe US and Israel are fairly isolated\u201d in the face of increasing global calls for a ceasefire, Julian says. As Israel continues its bombardment of Gaza, the human cost of the conflict has become intolerable for most countries, who are demanding the two sides find a route to peace.\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth pointing out that the US made a big deal about how isolated Russia was in the general assembly when it came to the Ukraine war \u2013 by the same measures it\u2019s an issue in which they are now in a relatively small minority,\u201d Julian says.\nBut US support for Israel is seemingly not unconditional. Though the US has stood alongside Israel in this vote, Biden has also issued his bluntest public critique of Israel\u2019s military strategy, saying that international support is waning because of the \u201cindiscriminate bombing\u201d of Gaza, adding that Netanyahu should change his government, which is dominated by hard figures. The White House has tried to downplay the president\u2019s comments during a press conference to dispel any further speculation about Netanyahu and Biden\u2019s relationship.\nA rift between Netanyahu and Biden\nBiden\u2019s approach to the conflict has been to keep Netanyahu close, in a bid to exert more influence over the way Israel prosecutes the war. The Biden administration believes it has achieved some wins with this policy: \u201cThey believe that they helped fend off a pre-emptive strike on Lebanon against Hezbollah, which there was support for in the immediate aftermath [of the attack],\u201d Julian says. However when it comes to minimising civilian casualties and long-term plans for the military campaign, the Biden administration has held little sway over the Israeli government. Civilian deaths remain high and Netanyahu has made clear that he will not allow any kind of Palestinian control over Gaza in future. \u201cBiden and his administration are getting more and more uneasy about their lack of influence,\u201d Julian says.\nConflicting ideas\nView image in fullscreen Joe Biden meets Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, 18 October 2023. Photograph: Reuters\nNews that the US has given Israel a deadline of the end of December to finish the conflict has been widely reported in the Israeli press (though a White House aide has denied the existence of any firm deadline). The Israel Defense Forces have said that they are prepared to keep the conflict going until the end of January, Julian says.\nIt is unclear what happens when these deadlines are reached: the IDF has proposed maintaining a significant military presence in the north of the strip, as well as creating a buffer zone inside Gaza \u2013 a policy that the US has publicly opposed. \u201cInstead, Washington wants to use this conflict as leverage to get back on to a trajectory towards a two-state solution, which is something that Netanyahu and his cabinet are really against. So they are very much at loggerheads,\u201d Julian says.\nInternal pressure\nBiden has his own problems to think about. His support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has caused a significant backlash from certain factions of his own party. With the president facing re-election next year, he is likely evaluating the political cost of maintaining his stance because \u201csupport for him on the left of his party has really suffered, particularly among progressives, young people and minorities\u201d, Julian explains.\nMilitary impact\nWhile the relationship between the two countries has become frostier in recent weeks, US officials made it clear that there are no current plans to slow the supply of munitions to Israel.\nUS support for Israel is not guaranteed indefinitely, however: \u201cThe last round of munitions was sent through an emergency measure that sidestepped Congress in quite an unusual move. As relations sour between Biden and Netanyahu, I can\u2019t imagine they would do that again,\u201d Julian says. \u201cThey can, very easily, put their thumb on the flow of ammunition, which the Israel Defense Forces really depend on, if they want to.\u201d\nThis week Biden warned Israel that \u201cthey\u2019re starting to lose\u201d international support. Though fraught conversations are certainly happening in the background, Biden, for the moment, has promised to support Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do a damn thing other than protect Israel in the process. Not a single thing.\u201d\nWhat else we\u2019ve been reading\nView image in fullscreen \u2018The screen police officer that other actors measure themselves against\u2019 \u2026 Andre Braugher in Brooklyn Nine-Nine.
