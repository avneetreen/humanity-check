They Fight. They destroy \u2026 My doctor provides. My mother provides.\u201d\nThe urge to lecture on appropriate language resurfaced last week as the 60-year-old Kirby \u2013 now the public face of White House foreign policy in his role of communications coordinator for the National Security Council \u2013 tackled an infinitely more emotive word: genocide.\nThe term, defined in an international treaty that was adopted by the United Nations in 1948, has been used by critics to describe Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza, launched in response to Hamas\u2019s attack on 7 October, which killed than 1,200 Israelis.\nThe Israeli bombardment and ground invasion has so far killed approximately 15,000 Palestinians and displaced more than 1.7 million people, forcing them into increasingly precarious conditions. Joe Biden has voiced unequivocal support for Israel and so far has resisted calls to press the country to accept a permanent ceasefire, opting instead to focus on humanitarian pauses and sending aid to Gaza.\nNow with polls showing Biden haemorrhaging support among Arab, young and ethnic minority voters over his support for Israel in Gaza, questions are growing over whether Kirby, arguably the most visible spokesperson for Biden\u2019s approach to the war, presents a liability for the president\u2019s 2024 re-election bid.\nView image in fullscreen People hold a Palestinian flag reading \u2018Against the genocide, support the Palestinians\u2019 in Paris, France, on 18 November 2023. Photograph: Mohammed Badra/EPA\nChallenged at a White House briefing to confront the term \u201cGenocide Joe\u201d by some protesters to described Biden, Kirby, who had previously ruled out \u201cdrawing red lines\u201d for Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, embarked on an animated exposition.\n\u201cPeople can say what they want on the sidewalk and we respect that. That\u2019s what the first amendment\u2019s about,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this word genocide\u2019s getting thrown around in a pretty inappropriate way by lots of different folks. What Hamas wants, make no mistake about it, is genocide. They want to wipe Israel off the map.\n\u201cAnd they\u2019ve said that they\u2019re not going to stop. What happened on the 7th of October is going to happen again and again and again. And what happened on the 7th of October? Murder; slaughter of innocent people in their homes or at a music festival. That\u2019s genocidal intentions.\n\u201cYes, there are too many civilian casualties in Gaza \u2026 And yes, we continue to urge the Israelis to be as careful and cautious as possible. But Israel is not trying to wipe the Palestinian people off the map. Israel\u2019s not trying to wipe Gaza off the map. Israel is trying to defend itself against a genocidal terrorist threat. If we\u2019re going to start using that word \u2013 fine. Let\u2019s use it appropriately.\u201d\nView image in fullscreen Protesters carry a banner reading \u2018All in the streets for Palestine.

Photograph: Emil Nicolai Helms/EPA\nFor left-leaning Democrats already critical of Biden\u2019s unconditional pro-Israel stance, Kirby\u2019s remarks embody what they see as a telling difference between the administration\u2019s attitude towards civilians killed in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and Palestinians killed in Israel\u2019s military onslaught.\nWhile the response to Kirby\u2019s past linguistic homilies were unrecorded, his latest foray provoked a significant backlash.\nWriting on X, the MSNBC commentator Mehdi Hasan pointed out that among those Kirby was accusing of using the word inappropriately were renowned Jewish Holocaust scholars.\n\u201c \u2026 multiple Jewish and Israeli scholars of the Holocaust have raised the issue of genocide,\u201d Hasan tweeted. \u201cNot sure Kirby is more of an expert than Omer Bartov or Raz Segal.\u201d\nBartov and Segal, both Israeli citizens, each have argued cases that flatly contradict Kirby\u2019s understanding.\nSegal, an associate professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Stockton University in New Jersey, has accused Israel of a \u201cquite explicit, open and unashamed\u201d genocidal assault on Gaza. Writing in Jewish Currents days after Israel launched its military retaliation against the Hamas attack, Segal said the country was already committing three of the five acts stipulated in the UN genocide convention.\nView image in fullscreen Palestinians and Romanian supporters hold banners, one reading \u2018Stop the genocide!

Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group. 3. Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d\nBartov, a professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University in Rhode Island, said multiple Israeli ministers and senior figures, including the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had made \u201cgenocidal statements\u201d and \u201cterrifying pronouncements\u201d that have never been revoked. Netanyahu has repeatedly invoked the Old Testament fate of Amalek, whose followers were condemned to annihilation after attacking the ancient Hebrews during their exodus from Egypt.\nIn commentary for the Council for Global Cooperation, a version of which was published in the Guardian, Bartov singled out comments by Maj Gen Giora Eiland, a former head of the Israeli national security council. Eiland told Israel\u2019s Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper on 10 October that \u201cGaza will become a place where no human being can exist\u201d before expanding on the theme in a 19 November article for the same publication.\n\u201cThe way to win this war faster and at a lower cost to us necessitates the collapse of the systems on the other side, not the killing of more Hamas fighters,\u201d wrote Eiland, who expanded his enemy definition to include the Gaza population whom he said cheered Hamas\u2019s atrocities.\n\u201cThe international community warns us of a humanitarian disaster in Gaza and of severe epidemics. We must not be deterred by that \u2026 severe epidemics in the southern strip will bring victory closer and diminish the number of IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] casualties.\u201d\nSumming up, Bartov wrote: \u201cIsraeli rhetoric and actions are preparing the ground for what may well become mass killing, ethnic cleansing and genocide, followed by annexation and settlement of the territory.\u201d\nKirby\u2019s embrace of an opposing interpretation comes amid reports of dissension within the White House among Biden\u2019s own staff members, many of whom are torn over the president\u2019s unambiguous support for Israel in the immediate aftermath of 7 October.\nView image in fullscreen People hold a banner reading \u2018Genocide\u2019 at a rally in Madrid, Spain, on 18 November 2023. Photograph: V\u00edctor Lerena/EPA\nHis comments also echo Biden\u2019s own rhetoric, which has invoked the historical Jewish experience of murderous antisemitism and emphasised Hamas\u2019s assault as the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. Biden has since tried to qualify his earlier public statements, meeting with Arab American and Muslim leaders and expressing regret over comments casting doubt on the Palestinian death toll.\nJames Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute and a veteran pollster, cast Kirby as part of a \u201cgroup think\u201d cabal surrounding Biden and impeding his political need to \u201cinch back\u201d from his initial post-7 October posture.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a spontaneous support for Palestine on this issue [among normally pro-Democrat voters] that\u2019s quite unprecedented and I know there are people in the party worried about losing this level of support,\u201d said Zogby. \u201cI know the president is trying to inch back, but there are people around him who just don\u2019t get it.\n\u201cI think Kirby is a liability, period. We had a meeting with the secretary of state [Antony Blinken] a while back and Kirby was there. But the next day at his press briefing he made comments that were just not on board with the conversation that was being had. It\u2019s almost as if he has an agenda that goes beyond the agenda that\u2019s developing.\u201d\nThis is not the first time Kirby\u2019s pronouncements have put him in the political line of fire.\nIn 2014, while he was the official spokesperson for the Pentagon under the then defence secretary Chuck Hagel, he was branded \u201can idiot\u201d by the late Republican senator John McCain of Arizona over his attempts to deflect criticism of the US effort to defeat the Islamic State.\nAfter being reappointed to the same role after Biden\u2019s 2020\u2019s election win, he was plucked to work in the White House in May last year, frequently appearing beside the administration\u2019s official press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, and emerging as a key proponent of US backing for Ukraine.\nKirby\u2019s level of behind-the-scenes influence in the corridors of power is unclear, despite the suspicion of at least one observer that he has his \u201cown agenda\u201d.\nIn announcing Kirby\u2019s White House appointment last year, Biden praised his \u201cbackground, knowledge and experience\u201d and highlighted his past role as a state department spokesperson, in addition to his ex-Pentagon post, as qualifying him to deal with the \u201ccomplexities\u201d of US foreign and defence policy.\nView image in fullscreen Doctors and members of NGOs hold placards outside Egypt\u2019s embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 16 November 2023. Photograph: Fazry Ismail/EPA\nIn recent days, however, it appears that the need to change the direction of a conflict whose human costs are spiralling has been internalized by the administration, with Kirby evidently on board.\nIn a telephone conversation with Netanyahu last weekend, Biden voiced opposition to Israel switching its onslaught following the end of the recent ceasefires to southern Gaza, where an estimated 2 million people are believed to have gathered \u2013 at Israel\u2019s demand. The president argued that Israel cannot repeat the sweeping operation it conducted in the northern part of the territory because the crowded conditions in the south creates the potential for deeper humanitarian suffering.\nIn a White House briefing on Tuesday, Kirby told reporters that the administration \u201cdoes not support southern operations unless or until the Israelis can show that they have accounted for all the internally displaced people of Gaza\u201d.\nThe White House has also made it clear to Israel that it expects increased aid levels for Gaza permitted during the pauses to be sustained even after hostilities resume \u2013 a policy that would presumably at least mitigate the darker consequences of the path mapped out by Eiland, the former Israeli national security council supremo who cited the benefits of \u201csevere epidemics\u201d.\nYet for many of the president\u2019s detractors, this brings little comfort \u2013 with Kirby\u2019s proxy role emblematic of what critics see as a sign of hypocrisy: the stark contrast between American condemnation of the killing of civilians in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and an apparent indifference to the number of Palestinians killed at the hands of Israel\u2019s military onslaught.\n\u201cFor me, Kirby is the mouthpiece of the American war machine and for those who have very selective outrage about the kind of civilians lives we mourn more than others,\u201d said Usamah Andrabi, the communications director of Justice Democrats, a progressive group whose eight congressional members have vocally supported Palestinian rights.\n\u201cMost of us don\u2019t understand why John Kirby, Joe Biden and Jake Sullivan [the national security adviser] don\u2019t take Israeli leaders at their word when they say they want to wipe Gaza off the face of the planet.\n\u201cIf Vladimir Putin said these things, I\u2019m sure they would believe it.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "How the White House\u2019s John Kirby is taking on the word \u2018genocide\u2019", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/04/john-kirby-white-house-genocide"}
