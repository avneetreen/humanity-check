Ukraine said on Tuesday it had secured a foothold on the Russian-occupied eastern bank of the vast river, for the first time confirming an advance that could open a new line of attack towards occupied Crimea. A Russian-installed official, Vladimir Saldo, said Moscow\u2019s military had pinned down Ukrainian forces who crossed on to the river\u2019s eastern bank and was raining \u201chell fire\u201d on them. \u201cOur additional forces have now been brought in. The enemy is trapped in (the settlement of) Krynki and a fiery hell has been arranged for him: bombs, rockets, heavy flamethrower systems, artillery shells, and drones,\u201d Saldo said. \u201cThey (the Ukrainians) are sitting in basements and run from one basement to another at night. In the last two or three days alone, total enemy losses have totalled about a hundred fighters.\u201d A Ukrainian advance on the Russian-held side of the Dnipro, a formidable natural barrier, would be a big setback for Russia\u2019s occupation troops on the western side of a 1,000 km frontline.

He said no one died or was injured.\n15 Nov 2023 16.55 CET The EU has proposed banning the export of machine tools and machinery parts that Russia uses to make weapons targeting Ukraine, documents seen by Bloomberg reveal. The proposal is contained in the EU\u2019s 12th sanctions package, which also includes a ban on diamonds, the outlet reported.\n15 Nov 2023 16.29 CET Russia said that all vessels, including Russian ones, had free passage through the Baltic Sea and said that any attempt to violate international law on the free movement of shipping was dangerous, Reuters reports. Denmark will be tasked with inspecting and potentially blocking tankers carrying Russian oil through its waters under new EU plans, the Financial Times reported (see earlier post at 13.42). \u201cI\u2019ll just remind you \u2026 that all vessels, including Russian ones, have the right to free passage through the Baltic Straits,\u201d Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry, told reporters. \u201cAny actions that contradict this violate international law,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you know how dangerous that is.\u201d\n15 Nov 2023 16.10 CET Russia says Ukrainian Nato membership is unacceptable in any form Russia has said that Ukrainian accession to the US-led Nato military alliance would be unacceptable, in part or in any other form, according to Reuters. \u201cWhether in parts or in any form, Ukraine\u2019s accession to Nato is unacceptable for Russia,\u201d Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for Russia\u2019s foreign ministry, told reporters. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, a former Nato secretary general, has put forward a proposal for Ukraine to join the military alliance without the territories controlled by Russia.

Zakharova said the US was using Europe as a \u201cstick\u201d in what she cast as Washington\u2019s \u201canti-Russian\u201d policy. Zakharova said the new sanctions would achieve nothing and said the west\u2019s sanctions had damaged the EU itself.\nUpdated at 16.20 CET\n15 Nov 2023 14.42 CET Denmark will be tasked with inspecting and potentially blocking tankers carrying Russian oil through its waters under new EU plans, the Financial Times has reported, citing three unidentified sources. Russia sends about a third of its seaborne oil exports, or 1.5% of global supply, through the Danish straits, so any attempt to halt those supplies would send oil prices higher and could trigger a confrontation with Russia. The FT said Denmark would look for tankers carrying Russian oil that did not have western insurance, a step that would hit Russian oil export income hard while snarling up the entire Russian oil production and refinery business.\nUpdated at 14.48 CET\n15 Nov 2023 14.27 CET Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said he has spoken with Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni.

At least seven other people were injured in the strikes in the Zaporizhzhia region, in which Russian forces fired three missiles in about half an hour, the regional governor, Yuriy Malashko, said. He said a civilian facility had been hit but gave no details, and said that homes and cars nearby had been damaged. Rescue workers had rushed to the scene after the first strikes but another attack followed, the interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, wrote on Telegram. \u201cEmployees of the State Emergency Service were already at the scene in a matter of minutes. Then the [Russian] invaders struck again,\u201d he said, adding that the two men killed were aged 31 and 34. He said the injured included three emergency workers and four civilians.

Nato said the joint acquisition by its members represented one of the alliance\u2019s \u201cbiggest-ever capability purchases\u201d, but did not give the overall cost. The jets will be operated centrally by the alliance, likely out of its Geilenkirchen airbase in Germany, with intelligence shared among the 31 members. \u201cEquipped with a powerful radar, the aircraft can detect hostile aircraft, missiles and ships at great distances and can direct Nato fighter jets to their targets,\u201d the alliance said. \u275dSurveillance and control aircraft are crucial for NATO\u2019s collective defence and I welcome Allies\u2019 commitment to investing in high-end capabilities\u275e\n\u2014 @jensstoltenberg\nTap the image for info on NATO's next generation command and control aircraft, Boeing\u2019s E-7A Wedgetail \u2014 NATO (@NATO) November 15, 2023\nUpdated at 14.08 CET", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Russia-Ukraine war: Russia confirms Ukrainian troops have crossed Dnipro River - as it happened", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/15/russia-ukraine-war-live-avdiivka-highly-costly-for-overall-russian-offensive-says-zelenskiy"}
