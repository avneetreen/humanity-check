Finland joined NATO in April.\nNew members must be approved by all existing members of the alliance. Turkey and Hungary are the only NATO countries that have not formally approved Sweden\u2019s accession bid.\nTurkey has delayed ratification for more than a year, accusing Sweden of not taking Turkey\u2019s security concerns seriously enough, including its fight against Kurdish militants and other groups that Ankara considers to be security threats.\nIn comments published Wednesday by state-run Anadolu Agency, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan linked the ratification of Sweden\u2019s NATO membership to the approval by the U.S. Congress of Turkey\u2019s request to purchase 40 F-16 fighter jets and kits to modernize its existing fleet.\nThe request has been backed by the White House but run into opposition in Congress.\n\u201cI fulfilled my duty, but I also expect something from you,\u201d Erdogan told a group of journalists, on his way back from Qatar where he attended the 44th Gulf Cooperation Council Council summit. \"You (the United States) should pass the (F-16s) issue simultaneously in your Congress.\u201d\nLast week, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he told Turkey\u2019s president that \u201cthe time has come\u201d to let Sweden become a member of the military alliance.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "NATO member-to-be Sweden and the US sign defense deal, saying it strengthens regional security", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sweden-ap-nato-recep-tayyip-erdogan-washington-b2459354.html"}
