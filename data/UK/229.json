Nuclear weapons? Sure. A space programme? Natch. But the latest geopolitical must-have is superficially more niche: a supersonic, hyper-nationalistic blockbuster air force film. There wasn\u2019t a soul on the planet who failed to notice the media sonic boom as Tom Cruise passed overhead with Top Gun: Maverick in May 2022, while its Chinese counterpart Born to Fly came out a year later. And this month India gets in on the game with its own flyboy extravaganza Fighter, starring Hrithik Roshan, whose quiff alone qualifies as some kind of national monument.\nIn the surest sign of its geopolitical decline, Russia has yet to make one. But China and India are on the up, propelled by rulers with autocratic bents who want the full soft-power furnishings. The US went through a similar jingoistic spurt in the 1980s, wallpapered by a set of militaristic movie hits: the original Top Gun, the second and third Rambo films, Commando, Red Dawn and more. China has been flexing its cinematic muscles for a decade now, with actioners such as the Wolf Warrior franchise and Operation Red Sea, not to mention a raft of historic films with patriotic overtones. Narendra Modi\u2019s India has been less able to manhandle its film industry into line, with sporadic bellicose output like the Pakistan-cuffing Baaghi 2 and Uri: The Surgical Strike. But Fighter, released for the country\u2019s 75th Republic Day and featuring Roshan emerging from a chopper with a billowing Tira\u1e45g\u0101, as the Indian tricolour is known, in tow, suggest pressure may be mounting.\nThe air force flick remains the ne plus ultra of military film-making; pure cinematic surface, those gleaming Ray-Bans and pristine contrails breezily aestheticising the modern superpower\u2019s elite capability. It\u2019s not hard to see why China and India want a Top Gun: at the same time as being 1986\u2019s top-grossing film and launching Cruise as an American icon, the movie also functioned as soft-power projection of hard power, and recruiting advert for the US military to boot. Shot by ad man Tony Scott with the swaggering back-lit glamour of a sportscast, it made warfare look like a blast. Intentionally so: the script was approved by the Department of Defense, in return for access to the military equipment and locations without which the film couldn\u2019t have been made. A single F-14 fighter, the plane flown by Maverick, was worth $38m \u2013 more than twice the film\u2019s entire budget. Top Gun is \u2013 to put it straight \u2013 propaganda.\nView image in fullscreen Soft power \u2026 Top Gun: Maverick. Photograph: Paramount Pictures/AP\nWith Born to Fly, China found that pulling the same stunt isn\u2019t so easy. Focusing, like Top Gun, on a group of trainee pilots, the mission objective is chiding the unspecified foreign powers displaying a lamentably casual attitude to Chinese airspace, such as the two interlopers who declare, with American accents, in the intro: \u201cWe can come and go whenever we want.\u201d It is also there to put the country\u2019s J-20 stealth fighter in the shop window. Director Liu Xiaoshi was a company man, having made films for the Aviation Industry Corporation of China for 15 years. But it seems that in the wake of Top Gun: Maverick\u2019s mammoth $1.5bn run (none of which was earned in China, where the film was never cleared for release), Beijing got cold feet about engaging with the enemy. Born to Fly was pulled from release in 2022, just prior to the country\u2019s National Day on 1 October, supposedly in order to overhaul its sub-par special effects. The film belatedly came out last year to earn $117.3m; peanuts compared to the Wolf Warriors\u2019 huge grosses.\nBut the real inferiority is in the cockpit, with the film\u2019s human element. Compared to Top Gun\u2019s Maverick, with his inverted, middle-finger diplomacy, its protagonist Lei Yu (played by boy band singer Wang Yibo) is hopelessly bland. Top Gun operated under a form of opt-in censorship, with Hollywood trading script approval for kit; Chinese directors are subject to the compulsory kind, with every script vetted. And in Born to Fly, it shows in the neutered portrayal. There\u2019s no question of fraternisation between soldiers on any level, let alone the kind of blazing gay subtext leapt on by Quentin Tarantino. Job thrills in the Chinese air force apparently consist of occasional dumpling nights with your superiors, a strange obsession with the intricacies of parachute-folding, and the masochistic ethos \u2013 with an emphasis on suffering for the collective good \u2013 that features in all Chinese state-sponsored military films.\nView image in fullscreen High flier \u2026 boy band singer Wang Yibo in Born to Fly.

Unsurprisingly, it has been produced in co-operation with the Indian armed forces, filming partly at the air force academy in the southern Indian city of Dundigal. So it probably won\u2019t be some hard-hitting expos\u00e9 of military inculcation methods, with Roshan not quite having the superstar immunity that has allowed the actor Shah Rukh Khan to make statements in his films that cut across the grain of pro-Hindi nationalism. The title of his recent patriotic covert-forces hit, Pathaan, is the Hindi word for the Afghan Pashto ethnic group, which provides his character\u2019s origin story; a pluralistic twist on the Jai Hind blockbuster.\nFighter, like its gung-ho 1980s American models, may lack this kind of subversive intent. But that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t employ any guile whatsoever \u2013 if it has learned its lessons well. This is the great tactical advantage of the US soft-power model: wrapping propaganda in fluent entertainment. However proselytising Top Gun may be, it is simultaneously massive fun, sweating out attitude and sexual tension \u2013 at two ends of the spectrum, apparently \u2013 from every pore. And the franchise is emotionally adept too: the sequel manages to turn the \u201ctalking points\u201d apparently stipulated by the military into a resonant contemporary story about waning US influence, via our nostalgia for the cocksure Maverick.\nView image in fullscreen Dog fighting \u2026 a scene from Fighter.

Hollywood stays a safe distance from real-world precision, all the better to maximise its global box office appeal. But propagandist intent is behind all these careful script decisions, the guiding hand of hard power at the heart of Hollywood coordinated by one nondescript military liaison office on Wilshire Boulevard.\nCall it stealth propaganda: when audiences swallow the politics \u2013 or at least object less to them \u2013 because they are cloaked. China and India can feel the need for speed all they like, but they won\u2019t be packing the same box-office firepower unless they learn to go in under the radar.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "The need for speed: why China and India are fast-tracking their own Top Gun remakes", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/12/the-need-for-speed-why-china-and-india-are-fast-tracking-their-own-top-gun-remakes"}
