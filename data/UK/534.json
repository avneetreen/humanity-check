Even in places [such as] Beit Lahia there are still pockets of fighting. I don\u2019t believe we will ever be at the point of zero terrorists and zero weapons in Gaza,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFor a month we have been talking about a breaking point for Hamas when you will see its total collapse begin. That kind of term is useful when you are fighting conventional armies and you can find such a point, but the thing about Hamas is it\u2019s not even purely a guerrilla army.\n\u201cI would call it a very flexible entity which combines the characteristic ruling party, an underground organisation and charitable fund. It is not something where if you can kill the supreme commander the whole structure is undermined.\n\u201cInstead it is an ideological organisation where many will fight to the end. I do think even if Israel kills [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar \u2013 which I wish \u2013 there [will] still be others to take his place. It\u2019s in Hamas\u2019s DNA.\u201d\nPolling conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research this week appeared to reinforce such beliefs surrounding Hamas\u2019s ideology as it found 44% of respondents in the occupied West Bank said they supported the group, up from 12% in September. In Gaza, the militants enjoyed 42% support, up from 38% three months ago.\nMilshtein went further, arguing that he believed Sinwar wanted to survive.\n\u201cHis vision is that even if Israel kills 50,000 Palestinians, if he can demonstrate strong standing, the victory belongs to Hamas when the last Israeli soldier retreats.\u201d\nSpeculation surrounding Hamas\u2019s extensive tunnel systems, which are one of its key military assets, is that the emerging strategy of Hamas\u2019s top leadership \u2013 who have so far evaded Israel\u2019s attempts to kill or capture them \u2013 may be to hunker down in the hope that US and other international pressure brings a quick end to the most intensive combat.\nWhile the tunnel network has been presented until now as a largely homogeneous network, recently analysts have begun to distinguish Hamas\u2019s offensive tunnels, used for infiltrating Israel and ambushing Israeli forces in Gaza, from the more sophisticated \u201cstrategic\u201d tunnels used to shelter the group\u2019s leadership, including Sinwar, and to hold hostages.\nAnd while Israel has reportedly experimented with flooding some tunnels, Hamas has also boasted in return that its tunnels have been built to resist flooding.\nWriting in Yedioth Ahronoth, Nadav Eyal described off-the-record conversations with two members of the Israeli security cabinet over the challenges posed by the tunnels.\n\u201cHere is the truth: there is still no answer and organised combat doctrine for the tunnels, \u2018and as long as there isn\u2019t one, we\u2019ve got a problem\u2019, a security cabinet member told me.\n\u201c\u2018The solution,\u2019 said another member, \u2018will be a combination of systems. But there\u2019s no guarantee when it\u2019ll get here. Maybe this week, maybe in two months.\u2019\u201d\nAlso unclear is how much of the tunnel system Israel has so far destroyed.\n\u201cIDF intelligence was obviously not surprised by the existence of tunnels,\u201d said Milshtein. \u201cThey knew it was a very broad project but it is broader still than was imagined. What that means is that the IDF needs to be very effective in controlling the ground above if it is going to go against what is underground.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel tempers claims of imminent Hamas defeat as both sides seem set on long war", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/16/israel-tempers-claims-of-imminent-hamas-defeat-as-both-sides-seem-set-on-long-war"}
