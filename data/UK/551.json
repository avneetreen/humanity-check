About 1,200 people in Israel were killed in the 7 October Hamas attack, according to the Israel Defense Forces.\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said there would be a \u201ctransition to another phase of this war\u201d that is \u201cfocused in more precise ways on targeting the leadership and on intelligence-driven operations\u201d.\nMr Sullivan, who met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, was briefed on \u201cobjectives, phasing, and setting conditions for shifts over time from high-intensity clearing operations to lower intensity surgical operations against Hamas remnants\u201d during his meetings in Tel Aviv.\nThe White House said Mr Sullivan \u201cdescribed US efforts in coordination with allies and partners to deter any attempt to expand the conflict regionally, including in the Red Sea, and expressed President Biden\u2019s commitment to restoring calm along the Blue Line [the unofficial frontier between Lebanon and Israel] through a combination of deterrence and diplomacy\u201d.\nThe timing of such a transition is unclear but remains part of \u201cintensive discussion between the United States and Israel,\u201d a top White House aide said.\nMr Sullivan, who left Israel on Friday, also said in a statement that his Israeli counterpart, Tzachi Hanegbi, had informed him that the Israeli government is now allowing the use of the Kerem Shalom border crossing for delivery of aid into Gaza.\n\u201cWe welcome this significant step,\u201d he said, adding that President Joe Biden had personally raised the matter with Mr Netanyahu.\nMr Sullivan also said that the US \u201cremains committed to expanding and sustaining the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza\u201d and \u201cwill continue to work closely with Egypt and other partners\u201d to ensure that aid continues to flow into Gaza through the Rafah border crossing as well.\n\u201cWe hope that this new opening will ease congestion and help facilitate the delivery of life-saving assistance to those who need it urgently in Gaza,\u201d he added.\nWith additional reporting by agencies", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "US urges Israel to switch from Gaza bombardment to \u2018precise targeting\u2019 of Hamas", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jake-sullivan-israel-hamas-war-b2464836.html"}
