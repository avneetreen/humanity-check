The most prominent Palestinian released is Israa Jaabis, 37, who was convicted of detonating a gas cylinder in her car at a checkpoint in 2015, wounding a police officer. She was sentenced to 11 years in prison.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Israeli military says released hostages have arrived in Israel", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/11/25/israel-palestine-latest-news-ceasefire-hostage-release/"}
