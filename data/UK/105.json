He attended schools in nearby Gretna and an all-boys Catholic preparatory high school in New Orleans. Last year, he made a temporary move to the occupied territory, where his father grew up, to be closer to relatives and improve his Arabic before returning to the US for college, according to his family.\nOn 19 January, he was reportedly in a car in the village of Al-Mazra\u2019a Al-Sharqiya, roughly 10 miles northeast of Ramallah, when an Israeli settler began firing at him and others, followed by fire from Israeli military, according to accounts from his family and Defence for Children International \u2013 Palestine.\nA statement from the Israel Defense Forces reported an off-duty police officer and a civilian \u201cfired toward a Palestinian individual\u201d who was reportedly throwing rocks.\nHis family and witnesses have disputed Israel\u2019s account. \u201cIf they were throwing rocks 150 meters to the street, what is it going to do to a tank? Or to a jeep? Or to a car full of soldiers? You\u2019re gonna shoot the car 10 times because a guy threw a rock?\u201d his father Hafeth told NBC News.\nTawfic Abdel Jabbar (Defence for Children International \u2013 Palestine)\nHis father reported arriving at the scene to find his son bleeding in a truck with bullet wounds in his chest and neck, while people in IDF uniforms pointed guns at him and others with a warning to stay away from the area.\nAt his funeral on Saturday, his father called the US \u201ckiller machines\u201d for its unflinching support of Israel\u2019s military. \u201cThey are using our tax dollars in the US to support the weapons to kill our own children,\u201d he said, according to the Associated Press.\nImages from Tawfic\u2019s funeral show mourners gathering around his body as it lies on a bed of flowers with his head wrapped in a keffiyeh.\n\u201cThey demolished his dreams, not just his life. Instead of having produced a productive citizen, our tax money sent him to the grave. This is not right,\u201d according to Nabil Abukhader, president of Masjid Omar, Tawfic\u2019s hometown mosque in Harvey, Louisiana, where family and friends and Muslim community members held a packed vigil on Saturday.\n\u201cOur administration should stand firm to stop this genocide,\u201d he said, according to New Orleans newspaper Gambit. \u201cAnd we should use our money and our influence to spread peace everywhere, for everybody.\u201d\nThe mother of 17-year-old Palestinian Tawfic Abdel Jabbar mourns over his body before a funeral procession in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on 20 January.

Most of the victims were women and children.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "US demands \u2018urgent\u2019 investigation into Israeli killing of American teen in West Bank", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tawfic-abdel-jabbar-biden-israel-b2483489.html"}
