That\u2019s more than the total greenhouse gas emissions produced in the UK last year.\nTo offer minimal compensation for damage caused by those emissions, the US military should offer $106bn in international climate financing, while the UK military should offer $5bn, the researchers write, employing an equation drawn up by a Columbia University researcher in 2021.\nThose figures, though eye-popping, are \u201cextremely conservative\u201d, the authors say.\n\u201cWe wanted to get a sense of the minimum scale of climate finance that both of these countries owe due to the effects of their military operations,\u201d said Khem Rogaly, a researcher at Common Wealth and study co-author. \u201cBut it really is the minimum.\u201d\nOne reason: they are based on \u201copaque\u201d and \u201cincomplete\u201d data from the US and UK governments, which don\u2019t include most emissions from the institutions\u2019 supply chains. The figures omit data from 2017 and 2018, when the UK military failed to report its emissions estimates, and from 2022, which the US has not yet released. They also fail to account for certain climate impacts of military activity such as the unique climate-warming properties of jet fuel, among other issues.\nThe UK and the US have made some plans to clean up their militaries\u2019 emissions imprints.\nThe environmental impact wreaked by the US and UK militaries extends far beyond warming from greenhouse gas emissions, the researchers say. The social cost of carbon doesn\u2019t account for health impacts to communities near military activity \u2013 from Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands, where nuclear testing in the 40s and 50s led to severe environmental damage; to Vieques, Puerto Rico, where decades of US navy chemical pollution significantly increased the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disease for locals; to Iraq, where troops\u2019 use of depleted uranium led to widespread health issues including birth defects during the Gulf war and the 2003 invasion.\n\u201cThese two militaries have about 900 bases overseas,\u201d said Rogaly. \u201cThe effects of having all these military installations across the world is going to be extremely severe when you\u2019re supplying them with fossil fuels, clearing land, building installations for military activity, contaminating with toxic waste.\u201d\nBasav Sen, climate policy project director at the Institute for Policy Studies thinktank, who reviewed the report, said the research is \u201ccrucial\u201d.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t account for our emissions without accounting for the military-industrial complex,\u201d he said.\nView image in fullscreen The US military is the world\u2019s largest institutional greenhouse gas emitter.

During the Paris talks in 2015, leaders technically removed the exemption, but made military emissions reporting optional.\nRedressing the contributions\nThe report recommends that the two countries contribute a combined $111bn to an independently governed fund for low-income countries on the frontlines of the climate crisis, with regions closest to US and UK military infrastructure receiving the most aid.\nThese funds should come out of military budgets, and both countries should be required to close a percentage of their bases, the authors write. They also say the two nations should create a global military \u201csuperfund\u201d program to pay for cleanup efforts \u201cthrough direct payments, technology transfer, and job training at sites\u201d.\nBoth the US and the UK should also be required to undertake a comprehensive audit of the environmental damage they have caused, the study says. And the two governments should transition some of their military and arms manufacturing sectors to focus on green manufacturing, the authors say, drawing inspiration from previous worker-led conversion projects, such as the 1970s plan by workers at the UK\u2019s Lucas Aerospace \u2013 created when facing cuts to production \u2013 to shift to producing needed goods like medical equipment and heat pumps.\nLast year, the US Department of Defense began a process to address supply chain emissions, and in 2020, the agency announced it had slashed its emissions by 23% relative to 2008 levels (though those figures also didn\u2019t include highly polluting ships, aircrafts, or combat vehicles). The UK Ministry of Defence has also said it has cut pollution and \u201cincreased its sustainability activity\u201d in line with plans to reach net zero emissions across all UK sectors by 2050.\nBut \u201cgreening\u201d militaries while maintaining existing operations is not a good solution, the authors say.\n\u201c\u2018Green\u2019 fuels won\u2019t cut it,\u201d said Rogaly. \u201cOnly a reparative program that extends from base closures and reduced operations to environmental remediation, climate finance and just transition plans for military workers is up to the task.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "US and UK militaries \u2018owe\u2019 combined $111bn in climate reparations - study", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/06/study-us-and-uk-militaries-owe-combined-111bn-in-climate-reparations"}
