We saw decomposed body parts. We saw death.\u201d\nIsrael\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said that Israeli forces were operating \u201cin the heart of Gaza City\u201d which he described as \u201cthe largest terrorist base ever built\u201d.\nGallant also claimed that Hamas\u2019 most senior leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, was isolated in his bunker, adding that the militant chief was \u201ccut off from his surroundings, [and] his chain of command is weakening\u201d.\nHundreds of thousands of people are feared to still be trapped in the city. Hamas, which has long used the tactic of hiding among civilians, has been accused of blocking people from leaving their homes.\nIsrael has repeatedly told civilians to move south for their own safety but continued to bomb the entire strip, striking the southern city of Khan Younis on Tuesday, killing 23 people according to Palestinian health officials.\nA man rescued from the rubble of a house where medics said 11 people had been killed said that Israel would be \u201ctaught a very tough lesson\u201d.\n\u201cThis is the bravery of the so-called Israel, they show their might and power against civilians, babies inside, kids inside, and elderly.\u201d\nView image in fullscreen A Palestinian man wounded in the Israeli bombardment is brought to al-Aqsa hospital on Monday. Photograph: Adel Hana/AP\nNearly a month after Israel imposed a \u201ccomplete siege\u201d on Gaza, the World Health Organization said medical supplies were so low that doctors were performing operations, including amputations, without anaesthetic. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has said Gaza was becoming a \u201cgraveyard for children\u201d, calling for an urgent ceasefire.\nMeanwhile, in Israel on Tuesday people held a minute\u2019s silence to mark a month since the Hamas attack that killed 1,400 people in communities near the frontier and led to the current bombardment of Gaza.\nThe night before, a vigil in Jerusalem was held, with a candle lit for each victim.\nRelatives of the dead gathered at Jerusalem\u2019s Western Wall, where prayers were held to mark the first month of grief, in line with Jewish tradition. \u201cWe don\u2019t have other ways to commemorate them except with prayers, lighting candles, and having them in our heart,\u201d Yossi Rivlin, whose two brothers were killed at the music festival massacre during the Hamas attack.\nStanding before a giant Israeli flag, the army\u2019s chief cantor, Shai Abramson, gave a prayer for the dead, modified to include a blessing for security forces personnel who had died.\nIsrael\u2019s bombardment in retaliation for the Hamas raid, in which fighters also seized 240 hostages, has killed more than 10,000 people, including about 4,100 children, according to Palestinian health officials.\n00:01:22 Israel to take 'security responsibility' for Gaza for \u2018indefinite period\u2019, says Netanyahu \u2013 video\nNetanyahu, in comments that offered the clearest indication yet that Israel plans to keep a tight grip over the strip, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, has said his country will take \u201coverall security responsibility\u201d for Gaza.\nAsked who should \u201cgovern\u201d Gaza after the fighting ends, he told ABC News in an interview broadcast on Monday night: \u201cThose who don\u2019t want to continue the way of Hamas,\u201d adding: \u201cIsrael will for an indefinite period \u2026 have the overall security responsibility because we\u2019ve seen what happens when we don\u2019t have that security responsibility.\u201d\nThe White House reiterated on Tuesday that President Joe Biden does not support an Israeli reoccupation of the Gaza Strip after the war.\n\u201cThe president still believes that a reoccupation of Gaza by Israeli forces is not good,\u201d White House national security council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for Israel; not good for the Israeli people.\u201d\nHe added that there needed to be a \u201chealthy set of conversations about what post-conflict Gaza looks like and what governance looks like\u201d and that he would leave it to Netanyahu to clarify what he meant by \u201cindefinite.\u201d\nThe UN and other world bodies, including the EU, consider Gaza to be occupied \u2013 despite Israel withdrawing its forces from inside the strip in 2005 \u2013 as Israel has maintained effective control over the small territory by land, sea and air.\nNetanyahu also said he would consider hour-long \u201ctactical little pauses\u201d in fighting to allow aid to enter or hostages to leave Gaza, but again rejected calls for a ceasefire.\nView image in fullscreen Palestinian firefighters attempt to put out a fire after Israeli strikes on a residential building in Khan Younis. Photograph: Mohammed Salem/Reuters\nBoth Israel and Hamas have rebuffed mounting calls for a halt to fighting. Israel says hostages should be released first, while Hamas says it will neither free them nor stop fighting while Gaza is under assault.\nRights groups and UN experts have accused both sides of war crimes. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, began a five-day visit to the Middle East on Tuesday, although he had still not secured permission from Israel to visit.\n\u201cIt has been one full month of carnage, of incessant suffering, bloodshed, destruction, outrage and despair,\u201d T\u00fcrk said in a statement. \u201cHuman rights violations are at the root of this escalation and human rights play a central role in finding a way out of this vortex of pain.\u201d\nView image in fullscreen A candlelight vigil in Tel Aviv at the weekend. Photograph: Alexi J Rosenfeld/Getty Images\nInternational organisations have said Gaza\u2019s hospitals cannot cope with the wounded, and food and clean water are running out, with aid deliveries nowhere near enough. \u201cWe need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. It\u2019s been 30 days. Enough is enough. This must stop now,\u201d said a statement from the heads of several UN bodies.\nThe UN security council met behind closed doors on Monday. The 15-member body is still trying to agree a resolution after failing four times in two weeks. Diplomats said a key obstacle was whether to call for a ceasefire, cessation of hostilities or humanitarian pauses to allow aid access in Gaza.\nReuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018We saw death\u2019: families flee past tanks as Israel begins to storm Gaza City", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/07/we-saw-death-families-flee-past-tanks-as-israel-prepares-to-storm-gaza-city"}
