All of this has an unbearable toll on civilians.\n\u201cWe have fallen off a precipice. This cannot continue.\u201d\nIsrael\u2019s retaliatory strikes on Hamas after the 7 October attacks have involved the continued aerial bombardment of Gaza. The country has also intensified ground operations in the past 10 days and is attempting to dismantle a vast underground tunnel network.\nOn Thursday, overnight Israeli bombardments claimed the lives of dozens of Palestinians in Jabalia \u2013 Gaza\u2019s largest refugee camp \u2013 and Sabra, reported Al Jazeera.\nThe bombardments have forced thousands to walk long distances to seek refuge.\nCNN reported that a stream of people, including women, children, the elderly and disabled, made their way down Salah Eddin Street. This counts as one of the two north-south highways in Gaza along an evacuation corridor.\n\u201cEven in the context of a 56-year-old occupation, the current situation is the most dangerous in decades, faced by people in Gaza, in Israel, in the West Bank but also regionally,\u201d Mr Turk said.\n\u201cMy colleagues are among those trapped, and among those who have lost family members, suffering sleepless nights filled with agony, anguish and despair.\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s own obligations as an occupying power also continue to apply in full, requiring it to ensure a maximum of basic necessities of life can reach all who need it.\u201d\nEarlier this month, when Israel attacked Jabalia, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called it a war crime.\n\u201cGiven the high number of civilian casualties [and] the scale of destruction following Israeli air strikes on Jabalia refugee camp, we have serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes,\u201d UNHCHR wrote on X/Twitter.\nIsrael has rejected the UN\u2019s calls for a humanitarian ceasefire. In October, the US had vetoed a UN Security Council resolution for \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d to deliver lifesaving aid to millions in Gaza.\nOn Monday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would allow \u201clittle pauses\u201d in its assault on Hamas, according to the Associated Press.\nA day later, his defense minister Yoav Gallant dubbed Gaza to be \u201cthe biggest terror stronghold that mankind has ever built\u201d.\nGlobally, thousands of people have demonstrated against Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. A former UN official in New York, Craig Mokhiber, accused the organisation of failing to stop what he claimed was a \u201ctextbook case of genocide\u201d unfolding in Gaza, in a damning parting shot as he stepped down from his role.\nThe exodus has also been likened to the historical \u201cNakba\u201d \u2013 meaning catastrophe in Arabic \u2013 by a teenage girl quoted by CNN.\nThe term is used to describe the original displacement of more than 700,000 Palestinian people in 1948.\nIt was also used by the commissioner general of the UN agency for Palestinian Refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, in an op-ed for the Washington Post on Wednesday.\nMr Lazzarini wrote that \u201cthis exodus is reminiscent of the original displacement of more than 700,000 people from their towns and villages in 1948, also known as the Nakba (\u2019catastrophe\u2019 in Arabic)\u201d.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Both Israel and Hamas committing war crimes, says UN human rights chief", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-hamas-war-crimes-unhrc-b2444291.html"}
