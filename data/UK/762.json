Tuvalu has a population of 11,000, and its low-lying atolls make it particularly vulnerable to global warming.\nColonna said she was not sure if the French Pacific territories of French Polynesia and New Caledonia had the capacity to make similar offers.\n\u201cI\u2019m open to consider any specific request,\u201d Colonna told the National Press Club.\n\u201cBut ... the size of the Australian continent makes a big difference with the size and beauties of French Polynesia and New Caledonia,\u201d she added.\nColonna said the Australian deal initiated by Tuvalu was one way to address some of the challenges posed by climate change.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather see climate change being controlled and mastered,\u201d Colonna said.\n\u201cPreemptive action maybe is better than taking some corrective measures when it is late,\u201d she added.\nShe said she did not know the details of the Australia-Tuvalu treaty but was confident it respected basic principles of international law.\nThe treaty commits Australia to assist Tuvalu in response to major natural disasters, health pandemics and military aggression, Albanese said in a statement.\nIt also gives Australia veto power over any security or defense-related agreement Tuvalu wants to make with any other country such as China.\nTuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano said the new arrangement with Australia respected both nations\u2019 sovereignty and committed each country to supporting the other through such challenges as climate change.\nColonna spoke to the media ahead of a meeting at Parliament House with Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong aimed at increasing the two countries\u2019 cooperation in the region.\nDefense Minister Richard Marles flies to New Caledonia this week to meet French Armed Forces Minister Sebastien Lecornu and their South Pacific counterparts.\nFrance and Australia's relations have improved with the election of Albanese's government last year after a previous administration angered Paris in 2021 by canceling a 90 billion Australian dollar ($66 billion) contract for a fleet of French-built submarines.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "French foreign minister says she is open to South Pacific resettlement requests due to rising seas", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/australia-ap-tuvalu-south-pacific-french-b2457838.html"}
