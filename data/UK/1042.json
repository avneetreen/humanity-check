It said the body had been identified by forensic scientific examiners and the family had been informed.\nThe IDF accused Hamas earlier in the day of hiding evidence that would confirm that the organisation had used the hospital as a command and control centre \u2013 a charge Israel has made frequently in recent weeks as troops have advanced further into the territory and global anger has mounted.\nIsraeli special forces moved into the hospital early on Wednesday morning and continued to search the sprawling complex in the centre of Gaza City on Thursday.\n\u201cIt is important to emphasise that from the moment the Israel Defense Forces publicly exposed the use of hospitals for terrorist activity a few weeks ago, Hamas has persistently worked to conceal infrastructure and cover up evidence,\u201d an IDF spokesperson said\nHamas and medical administrators have strenuously denied the allegation the hospital was a command centre and the health ministry in Gaza said the Israeli military did not find any weapons in the hospital. A British doctor working at Shifa said the charge was an \u201coutlandish excuse\u201d.\nThe Shifa hospital has become a key objective for Israel because it dominates a sector of Gaza City where many government buildings are located and because proving the charge that Hamas used the hospital to shield military activities would help counter the international outcry prompted by the IDF offensive\u2019s high toll on civilians.\n\u201cThe soldiers are proceeding one building at a time, searching each floor, all while hundreds of patients and medical staff remain in the complex,\u201d an IDF spokesperson said.\n\u201cThe operational activity is being carried out in a discrete, methodical and thorough manner, based on ongoing field assessments and informed by questioning taking place in the field.\u201d\nThe IDF said that \u201cafter searching some of the hospital complex buildings\u201d, troops had found weapons as well as \u201cintelligence materials, military technologies and equipment, command and control centres, and communications equipment, all belonging to Hamas\u201d.\nIsrael\u2019s offensive into Gaza was launched days after Hamas launched attacks into Israel on 7 October that killed 1,200 people, mainly civilians shot dead in their homes and at an outdoor dance party. More than 240 hostages were also taken.\n\u201cDuring the searches, information and footage pertaining to the hostages abducted from Israel were found on computers and other technological equipment,\u201d the IDF said.\nJohn Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, was questioned by reporters on Thursday about the evidence Israel had so far produced to back its claims.\n\u201cWe have our own intelligence that convinces us that Hamas was using al-Shifa as a command and control node and most likely as well as a storage facility,\u201d Kirby said.\n\u201cThey were sheltering themselves in the hospital, using the hospital as a shield against military action, placing the patients and medical staff at greater risk. We are still convinced of the soundness of that intelligence.\u201d\nHe declined to say what if any intelligence Israel has shared on the hospital since its seizure by IDF troops.\nThe questions for Kirby came the morning after Joe Biden\u2019s full-throated support of IDF operations in Gaza, at Shifa in particular. Biden had suggested the ground operation should be more targeted than the aerial bombing campaign, which he said had been less discriminate.\n\u201cThis is a different story than I believe was occurring before \u2013 the indiscriminate bombing,\u201d Biden said on Wednesday night.\nMore than 11,000 people have been killed during the war in Gaza, with about 40% under 18, according to Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza.\nHuman Rights Watch said on Thursday that images released by Israel of weapons it says its soldiers found inside Shifa were not sufficient to justify revoking the hospital\u2019s status as protected by the laws of war.\n\u201cHospitals only lose those protections if it can be shown that harmful acts have been carried out from the premises. The Israeli government hasn\u2019t provided any evidence of that.\u201d\nIn a video shot inside Shifa, an IDF spokesperson said security cameras throughout had been deliberately covered, and showed a bag with an assault rifle with ammunition and grenades hidden behind an MRI scanning machine, holdalls with more weapons in closets and a computer with \u201ca lot of incriminating evidence\u201d.\nWriting in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the columnist Amos Harel said the IDF had moved into Shifa to pursue specific goals \u2013 exposing Hamas\u2019s use of medical facilities for military purposes and a search for intelligence about Israeli hostages \u2013 but also because of the hospital\u2019s \u201csymbolic importance\u201d.\n\u201cThe IDF wants to signal that even though the current raid has limited goals, there is no place its forces fear to enter and there is no place Hamas can feel safe,\u201d Harel wrote.\nOn Thursday, an IDF spokesperson said it had seized control of Gaza\u2019s harbour, a small port used primarily by fishing boats.\nA statement on X, formerly Twitter, said: \u201cDisguised as a civilian area, the harbour was used by Hamas as a training facility for their naval commando forces to plan and execute terrorist attacks.\n\u201cDuring the operation, conducted by soldiers of the 188th Armoured Corps\u2019 Brigade and Flotilla 13, numerous terrorist tunnel entrances and terrorist infrastructures were destroyed.\u201d\nInternet and telephone services collapsed across the Gaza Strip on Thursday for lack of fuel, the main Palestinian provider said, bringing a potentially long-term blackout of communications as Israel signalled its offensive against Hamas could next target the south, where most of the population has taken refuge.\nThe UN\u2019s World Food Program warned of \u201cthe immediate possibility of starvation\u201d in Gaza as the food supply has broken down under Israel\u2019s blockade and too little is coming from Egypt.\nSpeaking to CBS News, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was doing all it could to get civilians out of harm\u2019s way as it battles Hamas in Gaza, including dropping leaflets warning them to flee, but its attempts to minimise casualties were \u201cnot successful\u201d.\n\u201cAny civilian death is a tragedy. And we shouldn\u2019t have any because we\u2019re doing everything we can to get the civilians out of harm\u2019s way, while Hamas is doing everything to keep them in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\u201cSo we send leaflets, (we) call them on their cell phones, and we say: \u2018leave\u2019. And many have left,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\u201cThe other thing that I can say is that we\u2019ll try to finish that job with minimal civilian casualties. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do: minimal civilian casualties. But unfortunately, we\u2019re not successful.\u201d\nIsrael has said the goal of its military campaign is to destroy Hamas.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "IDF says it has found Hamas tunnel shaft at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/16/idf-says-hamas-hiding-evidence-of-use-of-shifa-hospital-as-command-centre"}
