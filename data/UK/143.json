It has been receiving hundreds of wounded patients every day since the fighting shifted to the south last month. There are fears it could be forced to close because of Israeli bombardments and evacuation orders.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent also reported \u201cintense\u201d artillery fire near the al-Amal hospital, while Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry said 77 people were killed and dozens injured overnight.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is fighting its farthest south so far in the campaign. Soldiers had \u201celiminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat and with the assistance of tank fire and air support\u201d, officials said. Israeli officials have accused Hamas fighters of operating from Nasser hospital, which staff deny.\nSo far, the conflict has displaced roughly 85% of Gaza\u2019s 2.4 million people. Many fled to Khan Younis and Rafah after Israel ordered civilians in the north to evacuate at the beginning of the war. They are packed into UN-run shelters, where food, water, fuel and medical care are limited.\nOthers are living in crowded private apartments, makeshift camps, under plastic sheeting pegged to poles on wasteland, or even on roads.\nAid officials who have visited Gaza say the crowding is almost unprecedented. Aid convoys have difficulty travelling along roads half-blocked by displaced families, and a journey that might have taken 10 minutes takes an hour.\nIsraeli officials say they try to avoid civilian casualties and issue evacuation orders designed to clear areas of residents before they attack. They accuse Hamas of using the population as a human shield. Hamas denies the charge.\nAnalysts in Israel say securing control of Khan Younis and Rafah is essential to achieve its war aims of destroying the military capabilities of Hamas and freeing more than 132 hostages abducted by the group in the 7 October attacks. About half of the 240 hostages seized by Hamas were freed in November during a short-lived ceasefire in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Some of those remaining hostages are thought to have been killed.\nMany of the hostages are thought to be held in Khan Younis, possibly in tunnels below the city. Control of Rafah is seen as essential to cutting off Hamas from its supply routes from Egypt, the analysts said.\nThe prospect of a major Israeli assault in or near Rafah, a town on the border with Egypt that has become a refuge for almost a million displaced people, has alarmed humanitarian officials.\n\u201cEverybody is deeply, deeply anxious. Many have been displaced multiple times. People don\u2019t see anywhere else to go. There is no real shelter anywhere else,\u201d said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, shortly after returning from a three-day visit to Gaza earlier this week.\nView image in fullscreen Injured Palestinians, including children, are brought to Nasser hospital to receive medical treatment following Israeli attacks in Khan Yunis.

Israeli officials denied this, and said Hamas had built a command complex under the hospital and used its facilities.\nThe hospital, which the World Health Organization described as \u201ca death zone\u201d after it largely ceased operations after raids and occupation by Israeli troops in November, has restarted basic services.\nDr Marwan Abu Saada, the director of surgery at al-Shifa hospital, said he was hoping to open an ICU next week and that some basic services had been restored but that fuel, power and medicine were still in very short supply. \u201cThe major oxygen generators are destroyed so we are relying on cylinders,\u201d he said.\nResidents of Khan Younis described heavy fighting and intense bombardment in the north and east of the city and, for the first time, in the west on Thursday, where they said tanks had advanced to carry out a raid before withdrawing.\n\u201cWhat is happening in Khan Younis now is complete madness: the occupation bombards the city in all directions, from the air and the ground too,\u201d said Abu El-Abed. The 45-year-old lives in Khan Younis after being displaced several times with his family of seven since leaving Gaza City in the north earlier in the war.\nLeo Cans, the MSF head of mission for Palestine, said the situation at the Nasser hospital there was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. Fighting had come \u201cvery close\u201d and an airstrike 150 metres from the hospital had killed eight people and injured 80 on Monday, he said.\nView image in fullscreen Palestinians look at graves destroyed in an Israeli raid on a cemetery in Khan Younis. Photograph: Ahmed Zakot/Reuters\nThe IDF confirmed on Thursday that it had removed bodies from An Namsawi cemetery near Nasser hospital, after reports that the graveyard had been destroyed by tanks and graves emptied. The IDF told broadcaster CNN it had taken the bodies to identify whether any Israeli hostages were among them.\nFootage also emerged on Thursday of Israeli troops blowing up the main campus of a university outside Gaza City in a controlled detonation \u2013 one of multiple universities they have destroyed.\nThe video, apparently taken by drone, showed a giant explosion engulfing the complex of buildings of al-Israa University.\nThe university, a private institution founded in 2014, said in a statement that its main building for graduate studies and bachelor\u2019s colleges were destroyed. It said Israeli forces seized the complex 70 days ago and used it as a base. The Israeli army had no immediate comment.\nIn a briefing note, the UN said the explosion had taken place on Wednesday and said reports suggested it had \u201cbeen used by the Israeli military as a military base and an ad hoc detention facility for interrogating Palestinian detainees before their transfer to an unknown location.\u201d\nA US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said at a press briefing that Washington had raised the issue of the destruction of the university with Israel.\nElsewhere in Gaza, where a communications blackout entered a sixth day on Thursday, hindering rescue and relief efforts, medics said an Israeli airstrike on a home killed 16 people, half of them children, in the southern Gaza town of Rafah.\nThe war began when Hamas launched bloody attacks on Israel on 7 October that killed 1,200, mostly civilians.\nA total of 24,620 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Gaza since \u2013 according to the territory\u2019s health ministry \u2013 with thousands more thought to be buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings. Tens of thousands more have been wounded.\nReuters reported that a strike had wiped out a branch of the Zemeli family in the early hours of Thursday. \u201cYesterday, I was playing with the children over there. They have all died,\u201d Mahmoud al-Zameli, 10, who lived next door and was a cousin to some of those who died, told the news wire. \u201cI\u2019m the only one still alive.\u201d\nReuters and Associated Press contributed to this report", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Fears grow for largest remaining hospital in Gaza as Israeli forces bombard Khan Younis", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/19/israel-gaza-war-largest-remaining-hospital-nasser-khan-younis-attack-fears-strike"}
