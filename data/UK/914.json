In a statement, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said: The release will begin according to the original agreement between the parties, and not before Friday.\nUpdated at 23.26 CET\n23 Nov 2023 04.55 CET US Central Command says one of its destroyers shot down multiple drones launched from Houthi controlled areas of Yemen early on Thursday. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, central command said the drones were shot down \u201cwhile the US warship was on patrol in the Red Sea\u201d. No damage or injuries were reported to the ship or its crew. Houthi rebels seized a cargo ship in the Red Sea earlier this week and have previously launched drones that were also shot down by US forces. On the morning (Yemen time) of November 23, the USS Thomas Hudner (DDG 116) shot down multiple one-way attack drones launched from Houthi controlled areas in Yemen. The drones were shot down while the U.S. warship was on patrol in the Red Sea.

Here\u2019s a piece by Daniel Boffey our chief reporter: No 10 should not implement plans to amend the law on glorifying terrorism after the pro-Palestine marches as it would do \u201cno favours\u201d to police, MI5 or the probation service, a government adviser has said. In a 15-page report submitted to the Home Office, Jonathan Hall KC, the government\u2019s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said there was no need to respond to the marches with new terrorism legislation, adding that there was \u201cgood reason for caution\u201d given both the risk of unintended consequences and the drain on limited state resources. Ministers have said they want to tighten the law on glorifying terrorism after the conduct of a minority of people on the pro-Palestine demonstrations in recent weeks, including the chanting of the controversial slogan \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\u201d, prompted calls for change. Some view the words as antisemitic and as encouraging the destruction of Israel.

Since Israel declared war against Hamas following its attack on 7 October, it has repeatedly accused the Islamic militant group of using Gaza\u2019s hospitals as cover. It has paid special attention to al-Shifa, Gaza\u2019s largest hospital, saying Hamas has hidden command centres and bunkers underneath the hospital\u2019s sprawling grounds. Associated Press has described how it was allowed access to Gaza on the condition that its journalist stay with the Israeli military convoy throughout the four-hour tour and submit all material to a military censor ahead of publication. It says there is no other way for foreign journalists to currently access the enclave. The agency wrote that on the reporting trip the Israeli military unveiled what it claimed was a Hamas military facility under al-Shifa, showing to a group of foreign journalists what appears to be a subterranean dormitory. The news agency writes: Dozens of soldiers escorted journalists through a narrow stone tunnel \u2013 which the military said stretched 150 meters (164 yards) to a series of underground bunkers beneath Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The living quarters, located at the end of the tunnel, had an air conditioner, kitchen, bathroom and pair of metal cots in a room fashioned from rusty white tile. They appeared to be out of use. Here is a picture from Reuters. The news agency explains that its images were reviewed by the IDF too as part of the conditions of the embed \u2013 but no photos were removed.

The Harvard Law Review, which is run by the school\u2019s student body, declined the 2,000-word essay \u2013 titled The Ongoing Nakba: Towards a Legal Framework for Palestine \u2013 by a Palestinian doctoral candidate, Rabea Eghbariah, after it had been edited, fact-checked and initially approved. The article, commissioned after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack on Israel, followed by an Israeli assault on Gaza, would have been the first by a Palestinian scholar ever published by the review. The Intercept originally broke the story. It argued that events in Gaza \u2013 where more than 14,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its military offensive \u2013 met the terms of genocide as defined by the United Nations convention. The article also called for a legally recognised crime of \u201cNakba\u201d (catastrophe), the Arab word used to describe the forced removal of Palestinians from their homes at the time of Israel\u2019s founding in 1948.

Abbas Raad, son of the head of Hezbollah\u2019s parliamentary bloc Mohammed Raad, was \u201cmartyred on the road to Jerusalem\u201d, the group said in a statement \u2013 the phrase it has been using to announce the death of its members due to Israeli fire since the war started on 7 October. It issued separate statements with the identities and photographs of four other fighters who were also killed. As we reported earlier, a source close to the family said that Abbas Raad \u201cwas killed with a number of other Hezbollah members\u201d in an Israeli strike Wednesday on a house in south Lebanon\u2019s Beit Yahun. Since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7, the frontier between Lebanon and Israel has seen escalating exchanges of fire, mainly between Israel and Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah, but also Palestinian groups, raising fears of a broader conflagration. Israel\u2019s army said in statements Wednesday evening that it had struck a number of Hezbollah targets and sources of fire from Lebanon, including a Hezbollah \u201cterrorist cell\u201d and infrastructure. Since the cross-border exchanges began, 107 people have been killed on the Lebanese side, according to an AFP tally. At least 75 are Hezbollah fighters but the toll also included at least 14 civilians, three of them journalists. Seven Hezbollah fighters have also been killed in Syria. On the Israeli side, six soldiers and three civilians have been killed, according to authorities. The strike came just hours after the four-day truce in Gaza was announced between Israel and Hamas, which is a Hezbollah ally. Iran\u2019s foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who visited Beirut on Wednesday, warned in an interview that if the Hamas-Israel ceasefire begins but \u201cdoes not continue... the conditions in the region will not remain the same as before the ceasefire and the scope of the war will expand\u201d.\n23 Nov 2023 01.38 CET A bit more on the delay to the ceasefire and hostage release courtesy of Reuters, which notes that neither side had announced time for either event, though an Egyptian security source told the new agency that mediators had sought a start time of 10am on Thursday. Reuters reports further: Israel\u2019s public broadcaster Kan, citing an unidentified Israeli official, reported there was a 24-hour delay because the agreement was not signed by Hamas and mediator Qatar. The official said they were optimistic the agreement would be carried out when it was signed. \u201cNo one said there would be a release tomorrow except the media ... We had to make it clear that no release is planned before Friday, because of the uncertainty that hostages\u2019 families are facing,\u201d Kan quoted a source in Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office as saying.\n22 Nov 2023 00.57 CET US President Joe Biden also spoke with the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad al-Thani, to thank him for his \u201cpersonal\u201d role in reaching the hostage and ceasefire agreement, the White House said in a statement. It said: The two leaders committed to remain in close contact to ensure the deal is fully implemented and to ultimately secure the release of all hostages. They reiterated the importance of protecting civilian lives, respecting international humanitarian law, and increasing and sustaining humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza. Qatar, where the political leadership of Hamas is based, played a key role in the negotiations.

It continued: He [Biden] also affirmed that under no circumstances can Gaza remain a sanctuary for Hamas where they can threaten Israel and Palestinians alike and imperil any pathway to a durable peace. The President affirmed his commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state and recognized Egypt\u2019s essential role in setting the conditions for that outcome.\nUpdated at 00.43 CET\n22 Nov 2023 00.29 CET Ceasefire also delayed, reports say Multiple news media are reporting that the ceasefire will also be delayed, as well as the hostage deal. An Israeli source told Israeli newspaper Haaretz that there would be no halt to the fighting in Gaza as long as there is no finalised timeline for the agreement with Hamas. The BBC also reported that an Israeli government source said there would be a delay to the ceasefire, which had been expected to begin at 10am (0800GMT) on Thursday with the release of hostages expected to begin shortly after. An Israeli official meanwhile told the news agency AFP early Thursday there would be no halt in the fighting between Israel and Hamas \u201cbefore Friday\u201d. The reports come shortly after Israeli national security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said late Wednesday that none of the hostages seized in the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7 would be freed before Friday.\n22 Nov 2023 00.12 CET US President Joe Biden \u201cemphasized the importance of maintaining calm along the Lebanese border as well as in the West Bank\u201d, in a phone call with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in which he welcomed the hostage deal, the White House has said. In a statement, the White House said the two leaders discussed the pause in fighting, which \u201cwill allow for surging in much needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza\u201d. It continued: The Prime Minister thanked the President for his tireless efforts, and those of his team, to help broker this deal. The two leaders agreed that the work is not yet done and the President assured the Prime Minister that he will continue working to secure the release of all remaining hostages.
