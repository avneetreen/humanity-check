But an hour later, a small group of demonstrators returned and fistfights broke out.\n\u201cTwo reports for battery were taken and will be thoroughly investigated,\u201d the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement Thursday. \u201cAt this time, we do not have suspects in custody relating to the battery, or for any other reason relating to this event.\u201d\nThe video has also been screened for world leaders and journalists in other countries, the Times said.\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called for unity after the Wednesday night fight.\n\u201cWe cannot allow current worldwide tension to devolve into this unacceptable violence in our city,\u201d she wrote in a social media post. \u201cThis is a time of immense pain and distress for thousands of Angelenos. We must stand together.\u201d\nThe Museum of Tolerance describes itself as the educational arm of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Jewish human rights organization named for a renowned Nazi hunter. A telephone message seeking comment on the clash was left at the museum's media office.\nThe brawl came two days after a pro-Israeli demonstrator died from head injuries following a confrontation with a pro-Palestinian demonstrator in suburban Thousand Oaks, northwest of Los Angeles. The death remains under investigation and no one has been arrested.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Demonstrators brawl outside LA's Museum of Tolerance after screening of Hamas attack video", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-hamas-los-angeles-police-department-karen-bass-simon-wiesenthal-center-b2444873.html"}
