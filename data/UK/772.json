Posting on Telegram, Tarnavskyi said: \u201cThe activity of the occupiers\u2019 infantry increased again in the operational zone of the Tavria Air Defense Forces \u2013 55 combat clashes took place. \u201cDuring the day, the enemy lost 440 personnel and nine units of military equipment.

For nearly two months, Russia has been trying to seize Avdiivka, an industrial town near Donetsk that has become one of the most contended points on the frontline. Russian soldiers are now on the east, north and south of the town, which is largely in ruins. It is nearly surrounded but is still served by a tarmac road. Ukraine says its soldiers are holding firm and repelling the attacks. View image in fullscreen A local resident walks in front of damaged residential buildings in Avdiivka, Donetsk region, Ukraine. Photograph: Reuters \u201cOver the past 24 hours, the number of (ground) attacks has decreased,\u201d Vitaliy Barabash, the head of the city\u2019s military administration, told the Ukrainian broadcaster Freedom. He said this was due to three factors \u2013 difficult \u201cweather conditions\u201d, \u201clarge losses in both (Russian) and manpower\u201d and the fact that the Russian army was \u201crunning out of steam\u201d. \u201cThere are fewer and fewer (Russian) people willing to go on assaults voluntarily, and there are more and more refuseniks,\u201d Barabash said. AFP has been unable to independently confirm his comments.\nUpdated at 14.23 CET\n3 Dec 2023 13.43 CET Ukraine and Poland will open an additional border crossing for empty trucks on Monday in order to open up a much-needed route for Kyiv, with some crossings blocked by weeks of protests by Polish drivers, Ukrainian authorities said on Sunday. Those protests, over what Polish truckers see as unfair competition from their Ukrainian peers, started on 6 November, with four border crossings now under blockade, Reuters reported. Polish hauliers\u2019 main demand is to stop Ukrainian truckers having permit-free access to the EU, something that Kyiv and Brussels say is impossible. Ukrainian border service said Uhryniv checkpoint, which is operating only for passenger cars and buses, would be opened from 1am (midnight GMT) on Monday for empty heavy vehicles with a total permissible weight of more than 7.5 metric tons. \u201cThe opening of Uhryniv is the first point on the list of measures implemented to unblock the border, reduce queues and increase the capacity of the Ukrainian-Polish border,\u201d the border service said. Ukraine said last week it had agreed some measures with Poland that could ease the pressure at the blockaded border crossings, but that they had not discussed the main demands of the protests.\nUpdated at 13.54 CET\n3 Dec 2023 13.04 CET An elderly man was killed during Russian shelling of Ukraine\u2019s southern region of Kherson on Sunday, regional officials said. \u201cThe occupants attacked the (Sadove) village.

He died on the spot from the explosive injury,\u201d the Kherson military administration said on the Telegram messaging app. Reuters could not independently confirm the report. Russian troops had abandoned Kherson and the western bank of the Dnipro River late last year, but now regularly shell those areas from positions on the eastern bank.\nUpdated at 13.12 CET\n3 Dec 2023 12.40 CET Russian forces hit a fortified commander post of Ukraine\u2019s \u201cEast\u201d air defence and alerting centre in the central city of Dnipro, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday.
