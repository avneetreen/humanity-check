Speaking at the Doha Forum in December, Lavrov complained: \u201cThe rules were never published, were never even announced by anyone to anyone, and they are being applied depending on what exactly the west needs at a particular moment of modern history.\u201d\nFor Hill, Biden\u2019s speech in October linking Ukraine and Israel together in his effort to persuade Congress to release funds for the former \u201cmay have been good congressional politics, but perhaps not good global politics\u201d. The victim in all this, she fears, would be Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymr Zelenskiy. He was \u201cgoing to have a hard time navigating this\u201d.\nBut America\u2019s selectivity, as perceived across much of the Global South, is likely to cause a wider reckoning. Quite often in the past Palestine has been treated as a special historical case in global politics, and as an accepted preserve of the US.\nBut now, according to the Israeli specialist Daniel Levy, the issue has hurtled \u201cto the heart of what some people have called the poly crisis\u201d.\nLevy says: \u201cA US monopolistic exercise [regarding the fate of Gaza] is out of sync with the world we live in today and with contemporary geopolitics. In that respect, something important and interesting has happened, and perhaps even a source of some hope, which is, we\u2019ve seen that for so much of the so called Global South and in many cities in the west, Palestine now occupies this kind of symbolic space. It\u2019s a kind of avatar of a rebellion against western hypocrisy, against this unacceptable global order, and against the post colonial order.\u201d\nAt a time when multilateral institutions are fighting what Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, calls \u201cthe forces of fragmentation\u201d, how the US handles Gaza matters, not just to Gaza, but to multilateralism.\nIf the US defence of Israel continues to go wrong, one or two outcomes are likely. The trend to shifting transactional non-ideological alliances will grow. Forum shopping by countries or strategic hedging, requiring active portfolio management like financial hedging, will become even more the norm. Alternatively, America could find itself confronting larger and more assertive alternative blocs, whether it is an expanded BRICS, led this year by Putin, or other Chinese-led alliances.\nSix short months ago it looked so different. After a period of so-called westlessness \u2013 code for the division and malaise fed by a Trump presidency \u2013 the west in 2022 rediscovered itself and was proud it responded to Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine with unprecedented solidarity. Not afraid of war, or of losing Russian energy sources.\nRussia\u2019s army had not just been repelled at the gates of Kyiv, but been exposed as a morally bankrupt force guilty of heinous acts of barbarism in Bucha and elsewhere. Ukraine became the beating heart of today\u2019s European values, as Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said.\nThe liberal order, tattered by Iraq and defeated in Afghanistan, had revived itself. A total of 140 nations at the UN general assembly condemned Russia\u2019s invasion. Moscow\u2019s allies were silent.\nBiden staged democracy summits, and launched infrastructure schemes for the global poor to rival those of China. Biden, it was said, was making a pitch to the Global South as part of a distinct democratic tradition that harked back to Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s anti-imperialism, Truman\u2019s advocacy of the UN Charter (signed in 1945), and Kennedy\u2019s efforts to forge closer links with non-aligned governments.\nYet even then alongside this self congratulation was a nagging question of why so many of the west\u2019s natural partners viewed Ukraine differently. For instance, at the UN general assembly, when asked to do something practical to support Ukraine, such as impose sanctions, the number of countries supporting Kyiv dropped closer to 90.\nSome leaders just shrugged their shoulders with indifference. Paul Kagame, the Rwandan president, said: \u201cIt is possible in my case that I don\u2019t have to take sides with either side since I have nothing to contribute to this debate. It is in the hands of other countries, it does not concern me.\u201d\nEvidently, large tracts of the world did not see Ukraine as a global anti-imperialist struggle but a regional conflict within Europe, bringing them only higher food prices.\n\u201cWe believed that the invasion of sovereign territory and the extremely serious violations of international laws committed by the Russian army would automatically put countries on our side. We underestimated how strong Russian influence was on the African continent,\u201d said Alexander Khara, an international relations specialist at the Center for Defense Strategies, a Kyiv-based thinktank.\nIndeed, as Hill explained in the Lennart Meri lecture, held in Tallinn, Estonia this May, Putin skilfully tapped into a pre-existing well of resentment with a dying Pax Americana. \u201cThis is a mutiny against what they see as the collective west dominating the international discourse and foisting its problems on everyone else, while brushing aside their priorities on climate change compensation, economic development, and debt relief. The rest feel constantly marginalised in world affairs.\u201d\nIndia\u2019s external affairs minister S Jaishankar put it succinctly: \u201cSomewhere Europe has to grow out of the mindset that Europe\u2019s problems are the world\u2019s problems but the world\u2019s problems are not Europe\u2019s problems.\u201d\nNow with Gaza, the latent anti-American mood has been given boosters. That any legal or moral parallel exists between Russian and Israeli behaviour is of course rejected by the Biden administration, which instead says the true parallel lies between the war crimes of Hamas and the Russian army.\nPutin\u2019s invasion and destruction of Ukrainian cities was not an act of self-defence. It was not a response to a specific outrage in which Ukrainian forces had crossed into Russia and massacred young party-going Russians. It was a Russian assertion of empire and its sphere of influence.\nBut once the bombed-out buildings of Gaza get juxtaposed on social media alongside those of Mariupol on social media, it gets more complex. The issue of proportionality comes into play. The Israeli response looks closer to the US post-9/11 revenge, which Biden had specifically counselled Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, against.\nYet, by and large, the west, with some exceptions, fell silent about Gaza when Israel\u2019s assault began. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, was one who broke ranks, saying: \u201cI think that to deprive a civilian population of the basic services \u2013 water, food, medicine, everything \u2013 is something that looks like being against international law.\u201d\nBy contrast, the UK representatives at the UN in no less than 11 security council debates urged Israel to comply with humanitarian law yet never said whether the country had failed to do so.\nPressed for weeks to say if the loss of 18,000 mainly civilian lives could be in breach of international law, western leaders spoke only in conditional tense, adding they could not pass judgment since this was a matter for the courts. \u201cWe will not be drawn into a judge and jury role in the midst of all this,\u201d Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, recently said.\nContrast that with the words of John Kerry, US secretary of state in 2016 on the Russian role in the destruction of Aleppo. He said: \u201cIt is inappropriate to be bombing the way they are. It is completely against the laws of war, it is against decency, it is against any common morality, and it is costing enormously.\u201d\nOr Biden in Poland on the first anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cThey have committed depravity, crimes against humanity, without shame or compunction. They\u2019ve targeted civilians with death and destruction. Used rape as a weapon of war. Stolen Ukrainian children in an attempt to steal Ukraine\u2019s future. Bombed train stations, maternity hospitals, schools, and orphanages.\u201d\nNor was this just presidential stump rhetoric. In March 2022 the state department formally declared that, based on information then available, the US government assessed that members of Russia\u2019s forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine. \u201cOur assessment is based on a careful review of available information from public and intelligence sources,\u201d said the state department.\nIn a speech to the Munich Security Conference, in February 2023, Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, repeated that the US had formally determined that Russia has perpetrated crimes against humanity. \u201cWe will seek justice for the war crimes and crimes against humanity continuing to be committed by the Russians,\u201d she said. Not much equivocation or deference to higher judicial authority.\nMoreover, Ukraine broke a logjam in the US Senate about war crimes and its ambivalence towards the international criminal court, to which the US is not a state party. Within weeks, the Senate, under the urging of the Republican Lindsey Graham, had unanimously passed a resolution pushing for accountability measures, both internationally through the ICC and bilaterally.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines Europe Free newsletter A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Previously, the justice department could prosecute war crimes wherever they occurred, but only if either the perpetrator or victim of the war crime was a US national, a US lawful permanent resident, or member of the US armed forces. The amended law allows for the prosecution of anyone present in the US, regardless of the nationality of perpetrator or victim.\nAt the same time the US as a member of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group for Ukraine started furnishing the ICC with its evidence of war crimes, deploying a team of investigators and prosecutors to assist the Ukrainian prosecutor, general Andriy Kostin, \u201cin documenting, preserving and preparing war crimes cases\u201d. A more comprehensive reversal of congressional attitudes is hard to imagine.\nBy contrast, after two months of destruction in Gaza, the US state department has said it sees no need to begin any formal internal examination of whether Israel has committed war crimes, even though the weapons it has been using were supplied by the US, and by some counts more civilians were killed in Gaza in two months than were killed in Ukraine more than two years.\nEven the news that unguided dumb bombs had been used in almost half of the Israeli strikes, or that the president himself said he feared the bombing was indiscriminate, has not led the State Department to say it felt the need to conduct a formal investigation into breaches of humanitarian law.\nA cursory journey round the world reveals the impact this has had. The US, whether it likes it or not, risks becoming synonymous with double standards.\nUdo Jude Ilo, the Nigerian born executive director of Civilians in Conflict, is only one of countless African figures to give a warning. He said: \u201cWe are now in a situation where the identity of the aggressor or the identity of the victim determines how the world responds, and you cannot maintain an international framework of protection if it is available a la carte.\u201d The result, he said, is that respect for international humanitarian law is hollowed out.\nMandla Mandela, Nelson Mandela\u2019s grandson, said: \u201cUS officials are asked about the Israeli army\u2019s disproportionate use of force in Gaza, and the response is: \u2018We are not going to talk about specific strikes\u2019. But isn\u2019t this a question of principle, in light of the past weeks and the past wars in Gaza?\u201d\nAt a more stolid official level, Egypt\u2019s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, said: \u201cThe Global South is looking very carefully at the progression of this conflict and is making comparisons. And I believe that it is losing confidence in the viability of the values that have been projected by the Global North. This is a very dangerous situation because it can cause the unravelling of the world order.\u201d\nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil\u2019s president, and this year\u2019s chair of the G20, said at a Voice of the Global South summit in November this year that it was necessary \u201cto restore the primacy of international law, including humanitarian law, which applies equally to everyone, free of double standards or unilateral measures\u201d.\nMalaysia\u2019s prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, himself a former political prisoner, has repeatedly denounced Putin\u2019s invasion. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asked to condemn the aggression in Ukraine, but some remain muted in front of the atrocities inflicted on the Palestinians. It doesn\u2019t concern their sense of justice and compassion,\u201d he complained at the gathering of Asia-Pacific leaders hosted by Biden in San Francisco this November.\nThe Biden administration, with its unique relationship with Israel and insular political culture, has sometimes sounded tone deaf.\n\u201cName me one other nation, any nation, that\u2019s doing as much as the United States to alleviate the pain and suffering of the people of Gaza,\u201d said John Kirby, the NSC coordinator for strategic communications. \u201cYou can\u2019t. You just can\u2019t. The United States, through [Biden], is leading the effort to get trucks, food, water, medicine and fuel into the people of Gaza \u2026 and name another nation that is doing more to urge the Israeli counterparts, our Israeli counterparts, to be as cautious and deliberate as they can be in the prosecution of the military operations. You can\u2019t.\u201d\nOr take the deputy ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, casually scrolling through his iPhone as the Palestinian ambassador made an impassioned plea for Palestinian survival. Or Biden, one minute defending Israel, the next suddenly admitting indiscriminate bombing was happening. These are unforced errors, and they ricochet around the world, and on to Arab satellite channels, in seconds.\nJulien Barnes-Dacey, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, argues that the damage to American standing may ultimately be felt most not in the Global South but in the west itself.\nHe said: \u201cThat blow may be felt more by Europeans than the Global South. The west\u2019s response to what\u2019s happening in Gaza, and our inability to call out Israel, hasn\u2019t suddenly woken the Global South up to double standards but it has re-confirmed to them what they believe the West is about.\n\u201cIf you are a citizen in the Middle East or Africa you\u2019ve experienced double standards for quite some time, whether it be through European migration deals or compacts with authoritarian governments. But this conflict is forcing an unprecedented degree of self-reckoning in Europe that is creating deep discomfort among many here.\u201d\nThe same is true in left-wing politics in the US where, according to the Pew Centre, 45 % of Democrats think Israel is going too far, militarily, while just 18% think it is taking the right approach.\nMatthew Duss, a former foreign policy adviser to the senator Bernie Sanders, said: \u201cIf we simply say that those rules can be ignored by countries we like, or countries we have a special relationship with, we\u2019re not really creating a rule-based order at all. We\u2019re creating an order of might makes right.\u201d\nSo what comes next?\nPutin feels he already knows. He recently told a group of new diplomats: \u201cThe world is undergoing cardinal transformation. The underlying change is that the former unipolar world system is being replaced by a new, more just, multipolar world order. I believe this has already become obvious to everyone. Naturally, such a fundamental process will not be smooth, but it is objective, and \u2013 as I want to emphasise \u2013 irreversible.\u201d\nBy trying to dominate the diplomacy around Israel, and exclude other countries, Biden showed he did not understand the world being forged, he argued. Putin hopes all he has to do is encourage some sanctions busting, and wait for 5 November 2024 \u2013 US election day \u2013 when Donald Trump could be re-elected. Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cend the war in 24 hours\u201d is widely seen as requiring a significant loss of Ukrainian territory to Russia.\nTo prove Putin wrong, and to protect himself, Biden occasionally seems to realise he needs the Gaza war to end and this requires ending his self-defeating unconditional support for Netanyahu. The Arab states, however much they dislike Hamas and political Islam, want the conflict over, and so does much of Ukrainian civil society for which Gaza has been a triple tragedy \u2013 it diverted world attention, it discredited the concept of rules-based order, and it divided the west, weakening Biden and the EU.\nIt is understandable why Zelenskiy took the unambiguously pro-Israeli position he did, but Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said: \u201cIf you are arguing for a rules-based international order, if you want to be pushing back against countries taking territory with the use of force, then Ukraine should not be seeing itself as aligned with the Israelis.\u201d\nFor others such as Borrell, the worry is that the pre-existing trends towards a more more multi-polar, yet less multilateral world will accelerate.\nOnly the memoirs will reveal how much senior figures in the Biden administration feared, in real time, about the scale of the cumulative reputational damage being inflicted not just on Biden but to American prestige.\nFor the moment they give the impression of an administration slowly realising the limits of their ability to direct not just the outcome of this war, but what global order will come in its aftermath.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Why US double standards on Israel and Russia play into a dangerous game", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/26/why-us-double-standards-on-israel-and-russia-play-into-a-dangerous-game"}
