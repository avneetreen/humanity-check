China has surrounded the shoal with its navy and coast guard ships since a tense standoff with Philippine vessels more than a decade ago.\nA rich fishing atoll and a safe mooring area during storms, Scarborough off the northwestern Philippines coast is one of most fiercely contested territories in the South China Sea, where Chinese and Philippine forces have faced off in recent months.\nThe frequent confrontations, which led to an Oct. 22 collision of Chinese and Philippine vessels near another disputed shoal, have prompted the United States to repeatedly renew a warning that it\u2019s obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, if Filipino forces, ships or aircraft come under an armed attack in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea.\nChinese air force Col. Tian Junli, a spokesperson for the Southern Theater Command of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, said a Philippine warship trespassed into what he said were Chinese waters around Scarborough Shoal on Monday and was \u201ctracked, monitored, warned and restricted\u201d by the Chinese navy and air force for seriously violating \u201cChina\u2019s sovereignty and international law.\"\n\u201cWe urge the Philippine side to immediately stop its infringement and provocation to avoid further escalation,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe troops assigned to the PLA Southern Theater Command remain on high alert at all times to resolutely defend China\u2019s national sovereignty and security and peace and stability in the South China Sea.\u201d\nPhilippine National Security Adviser Eduardo A\u00f1o, however, said in Manila that the Philippine navy ship carried out a routine patrol of the waters in the vicinity of Scarborough \u201cwithout any untoward incident,\u201d but added that \u201cChinese vessels, as usual, conducted shadowing on the movement\u201d of the Philippine navy ship.\nA\u00f1o accused China of hyping up the encounter and \u201ccreating unnecessary tensions between our two nations.\u201d\n\"The Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine coast guard will not be deterred by the aggressive and illegal activities\u201d of China\u2019s navy, coast guard and militia forces, he added. \"We will protect our territory and sovereign rights at all cost,\u201d A\u00f1o said, citing the orders of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to Filipino forces.\nThe territorial disputes in the South China Sea, which also involve Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei, have long been feared as an Asian flashpoint and have become a delicate fault line in the regional rivalry between the U.S. and China.\nIn Beijing on Tuesday, Singapore Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen underscored the importance of efforts to prevent conflicts from escalating, including by establishing defense hotlines.\nSoutheast Asian diplomats expressed concern over recent flare-ups of the disputes in the South China Sea in a new round of talks with their Chinese counterparts in Beijing last week, two regional diplomats told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.\nDuring the talks on a proposed nonaggression pact, the Chinese and Philippine delegations had a \u201ctense exchange\u201d of renewed accusations over recent confrontations, one of the diplomats said.\nThe proposed pact aims to prevent occasional spats from degenerating into a major armed conflict, but the negotiations have been stymied by differences, including whether the agreement should be legally binding and what areas of the strategic sea passage it should cover.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "China's forces shadow a Philippine navy ship near disputed shoal, sparking new exchange of warnings", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-china-scarborough-shoal-manila-united-states-b2438956.html"}
