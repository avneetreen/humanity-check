He argued the ship\u2019s deployment violates a recent agreement between the South American nations.\n\u201cWe believe in diplomacy, in dialogue and in peace, but no one is going to threaten Venezuela,\u201d Maduro said in a room where he was accompanied by a dozen military commanders. \u201cThis is an unacceptable threat to any sovereign country in Latin America.\u201d\nVenezuela and Guyana are currently involved in a border dispute over the Essequibo, a sparsely populated region the size of Florida with vast oil deposits off its shores.\nThe region has been under Guyana\u2019s control for decades, but in December, Venezuela relaunched its historical claim to the Essequibo through a referendum in which it asked voters in the country whether the Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state.\nAs tensions over the region escalated, the leaders of both countries met in the Caribbean island of St Vincent, and signed an agreement which said they would solve their dispute through nonviolent means.\nDuring the talks, however, Guyana\u2019s President Irfan Ali said his nation reserved its right to work with its partners to ensure the defense of his country.\nHMS Trent is a patrol and rescue ship that was recently used to intercept drug traffickers off the West Coast of Africa. It can accommodate up to 30 sailors and a contingent of 18 marines, and is equipped with 30mm cannons and a landing pad for helicopters and drones.\nThe ship had been sent to Barbados in early December to intercept drug traffickers, but its mission was changed on Dec. 24, when it was sent to Guyana. Authorities did not specify when it was expected to arrive off Guyana's shores.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Defense Ministry said the ship would be conducting joint operations with Guyana\u2019s defense forces.\nThe nation of 800,000 people has a small military that is made up of 3,000 soldiers, 200 sailors and four small patrol boats known as Barracudas.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Venezuela will hold military exercises off its shores as a British warship heads to Guyana", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/nicolas-maduro-ap-guyana-venezuela-british-b2470588.html"}
