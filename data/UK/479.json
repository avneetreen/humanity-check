The European Union last week failed to agree on a $54 billion package in financial help that Ukraine desperately needs.\nAmid these signs of fraying Western support, Russia has ramped up its pressure on Ukrainian forces on several parts of the more than 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line.\n\u201cThe Russian military since October has been trying to seize initiative across the front in a couple of areas,\u201d said Michael Kofman, a military expert with the Carnegie Endowment.\nUkraine's military needs to reconstitute and regenerate its combat effectiveness after a grueling five-month counteroffensive, he said.\n\u201cUkrainian forces, while motivated, are exhausted,\u201d Kofman said in a recent podcast. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost a lot of units of action. They\u2019ve lost a lot of assault capable troops.\u201d\nOne area where Russia has maintained steady pressure is the northeastern city of Kupiansk, a strategically important rail hub that Moscow captured early in the war and then lost in a Ukrainian counteroffensive in September 2022. While Russian forces have failed to make any significant gains in the area, Ukraine has had to maintain a significant force to protect the city.\nStarting in early October, Russian troops also have launched an offensive around Avdiivka, a town near Donetsk, the center of the region that was seized by Moscow-backed rebels in 2014 and illegally annexed by Russia in 2022 with three other Ukrainian regions.\nUkraine has built multiple defenses in Avdiivka, complete with concrete fortifications and a web of underground tunnels, allowing them to repel fierce Russian attacks. Despite massive losses, Russian troops have inched forward steadily, seeking to envelop Avdiivka and cut Ukrainian supply lines.\nThat battle has evolved into a gruesome grind for both parties and has been compared to the fighting for Bakhmut, the war\u2019s longest and bloodiest battle that ended with Russia capturing it in May.\nThe Kremlin and the Russian Defense Ministry are silent about specific plans, but some Russian war bloggers say Moscow could launch a massive offensive of its own to forge deep into Ukrainian territory.\nOthers warn, however, that the Russian military lacks resources for any such big push, saying that would require many more troops and weapons, exposing it to the same risks that doomed initial Russian attempts to capture Kyiv and other cities in the northeast at the start of the war.\nIn that botched attack, Russian armored convoys stretched along highways leading to the capital, becoming easy prey for Ukrainian drones and artillery. Such setbacks forced the Kremlin to switch to a defensive strategy along the front line.\nPutin is eager to show battlefield gains as he faces reelection in March. He said last week that Russia has 617,000 fighters in Ukraine, a number that many war bloggers see as far short of the kind of massive force needed to strike deep into Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his ground forces number about 600,000.\nWestern observers are emphasizing the need for Ukraine to build fortified defenses like Russia has done to counter any potential big offensive by Moscow.\n\u201cUkrainians have painfully few reserves,\u201d warned Mark Galeotti, head of Mayak Intelligence consultancy and a senior associate fellow at Royal United Services Institute in London.\nIf Moscow manages to break through Ukraine's defensive lines, \u201cRussian forces could then really wreak havoc on lines of communication, lines of supply, rear supply bases,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn that context, it does make sense to allow fortification to make up for the lack of reserves,\u201d Galeotti said in a recent podcast.\nIn recent months, the Russian military has reduced the use of its long-range air- and sea-launched cruise missiles in what has been widely interpreted as a sign of Moscow\u2019s effort to build up stockpiles of such weapons to strike Ukraine's power grid and other key infrastructure in winter, when it is most vulnerable due to high consumption.\nAt the same time, Russia has stepped up attacks on Kyiv and other regions with waves of Iranian-made Shahed exploding drones, in an apparent effort to deplete Ukrainian air defenses.\nLast winter, Russian relentlessly pounded Ukraine\u2019s energy grid, causing long blackouts but failing to knock out the electricity network that showed a high degree of resilience. Ukrainian officials have warned, however, that this winter could be even harder due to Russian strikes.\nWhile the West has provided air defense systems to protect Kyiv and other key areas, it could be challenging for Ukraine to cope with massive missile attacks from different directions. Ukraine\u2019s allies also promised it a few dozen U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets, and Ukrainian pilots are training in Romania, but it\u2019s unclear when the warplanes will arrive.\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said the F-16s will strengthen Ukraine\u2019s air defenses but noted, \u201cThere is not a silver bullet, not a single system that by itself will change fundamentally the situation on the battlefield.\u201d\n\u201cWe must not underestimate Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cRussia\u2019s economy is on a war footing.\u201d\nWhile the West faced problems in maintaining the tempo of weapons supplies, with military aid hitting snags in Washington and Brussels, Russia has been increasingly boosting production of missiles, tanks and other weapons. The U.S. has said that Moscow also has started getting munitions under a deal struck with North Korea in September.\nThe Russian military has fixed many of its weaknesses and deficiencies that plagued it early in the war, and it has developed new weapons and tactics that helped derail Ukraine's counteroffensive. A key factor that effectively paralyzed attempts by Kyiv to attack with a big mechanized force during the campaign was the sprawling minefields and other fortifications that Russia had built in the south.\nOne deadly novelty that significantly strengthened Russia's military was converting Soviet-made dumb bombs into smart, gliding weapons equipped with winglets and a GPS system that allowed them to strike targets with precision far from the front.\nWhile Ukraine held a strong edge in drones at the start of the war, Russian forces since then have matched and even overwhelmed Ukrainian troops in using short-range small drones, which are now so prolific that Moscow is even them against individual troops.\nKofman said that while Ukraine pioneered the use of drones, \u201cRussia now has more of them and has an advantage in them.\u201d\n\u201cRussia will be materially advantaged in 2024 in artillery ammunition, in production of drones and likely long-range drones and cruise missiles, too,\u201d Kofman said. \u201cIf the West just assumes that it\u2019s a stalemate and can reduce its commitment to Ukraine, Russian advantages will compound because Russia doesn\u2019t accept the stalemate.\u201d\n___\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Putin ratchets up military pressure on Ukraine as he expects Western support for Kyiv to dwindle", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ukraine-ap-russia-vladimir-putin-kyiv-b2467008.html"}
