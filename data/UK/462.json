Narrow-body aircraft held a share of >45% of the market in 2022 and is estimated to maintain its unassailable lead in the market in the foreseeable future. The aircraft body type is likely to make the fastest comeback with the resumption of domestic air travel in various parts of the world. The market entry of COMAC C919 is likely to further substantiate the demand in the years to come.\nBased on the application type - The market is segmented into floor panels, cabin linings, stowage bin panels, galley panels, lavatory panels, cargo panels, and others. Cabin Linings held a share of >25% of the market in 2022 and is estimated to maintain its lead in the market over the next five years. Cabin linings include sidewall and ceiling panels of aircraft; therefore, they cover the largest area of application for the sandwich panels.\nBased on core material type - The market is segmented as nomex honeycomb, aluminum honeycomb, and others. Nomex honeycomb held a share of >80% of the market in 2022 and addresses most of the prerequisites of aircraft interior applications, such as high mechanical properties and high FST performance. Excellent strength-to-weight ratio; excellent corrosion resistance against water, oil, and fuel; high-temperature withstanding capabilities; easy formability; and good dielectric properties are other advantages.\nBased on end-user type - The market is segmented as OE and aftermarket. The OE segment held a larger share of >60% of the market in 2022. Commercial aircraft (narrow-body, and wide-body aircraft) account for most of the OE as well as aftermarket demand for sandwich panels. Aftermarket also occupies a healthy chunk of the market. 800+ airlines are active worldwide, generating a strong replacement demand for sandwich panels.\nTo know the attractive segments, click here for a free sample pdf:\nhttps://www.stratviewresearch.com/Request-Sample/274/aerospace-interior-sandwich-panel-market.html#form\nWhich Region Offers the Best Opportunity and Growth?\nThe report suggests that North America held a share of more than 40% of the market in 2022 and is expected to remain the largest market for aircraft interior sandwich panels during the forecast period.
