According to the UN, 1.87 million people, more than 80% of Gaza\u2019s population, have left their homes. Many have had to flee shelter several times to avoid the Israeli advance.\nThe UN Human Rights Office said on Tuesday that \u201cthe pattern of attacks that target or impact on civilian infrastructure raises serious concerns about Israel\u2019s compliance with international humanitarian law and significantly raises the risk of atrocity crimes\u201d.\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council said the Gaza war now ranked \u201camongst the worst assaults on any civilian population in our time and age\u201d.\nIsrael\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, claimed that the IDF was winning the war and that more than half of Hamas\u2019s battalion commanders had been killed.\n\u201cThe ground shook in Khan Younis and Jabaliya. We have encircled them both. There is no place we cannot reach,\u201d Netanyahu said on Tuesday. He said the IDF was winning every battle, but at \u201can unbearable price\u201d.\nThe IDF reported seven casualties on Tuesday and two more on Wednesday morning. Since ground operations began, 84 IDF soldiers have been reported killed in the ground operation, many of them as a result of bombs and anti-tank missiles fired at close range.\n\u201cPalestinian militia fighters continued to use more sophisticated tactics to target Israeli forces throughout the Gaza Strip,\u201d the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said in a report co-authored with the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s critical threats project. It cited an incident on Tuesday in which Hamas\u2019s military wing used explosives to bring down a house on top of Israeli soldiers in Khan Younis and detonated an armour-piercing shaped charge against an Israeli tank.\nHamas was also able to launch 15 rockets from Gaza hideouts on central and southern Israel on Tuesday.\nThe IDF said Khan Younis had become the main Hamas stronghold after the ground assault on the north began on 27 October, with four of the extremist movement\u2019s 24 battalions based there.\nIsraeli commanders believe that the Hamas hierarchy, including its leader, Yahya Sinwar, could be hiding in the extensive tunnel network below the city. Sinwar was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp and late on Wednesday, Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the IDF were encircling the the Sinwar family home.\n\u201cYesterday I said that our forces could reach anywhere in the Gaza Strip. Today they are encircling Sinwar\u2019s house. His house may not be his fortress and he can escape but it\u2019s only a matter of time before we get him,\u201d Netanyahu said.\nThe Biden administration has continued to urge Israel to do more to limit civilian casualties. Martin Griffiths, the UN\u2019s top aid official, said the IDF campaign in the south was just as devastating for the Palestinian population as its operations in the north, with US diplomacy making no difference to the outcome.\nOfficials from the US vice-president Kamala Harris\u2019s office are in Israel for talks on what should happen to Gaza after the war, which was started by a Hamas rampage through Israeli villages that killed 1,200 people, more than two-thirds of them civilians, on 7 October.\nIncreasing evidence is emerging of extreme sexual crimes committed by the Hamas attackers against female victims.\nWashington has insisted there should be no long-term Israeli military presence in Gaza, but Netanyahu has claimed there is no option for his country\u2019s security other than direct military control.\n\u201cGaza must be demilitarised. And in order for Gaza to be demilitarised, there is only one force that can see to this demilitarisation \u2013 and that force is the IDF,\u201d the prime minister said in a written statement on Tuesday.\n\u201cNo international force can be responsible for this. We have seen what has happened in other places where they brought in international forces for the goal of demilitarisation. I am not prepared to close my eyes and accept any other arrangement.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "UN chief warns Gaza aid delivery could collapse as Israel and Hamas fight house-to-house", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/06/israel-and-hamas-fight-house-to-house-battles-across-gaza"}
