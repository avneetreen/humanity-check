He will endeavor to keep up international focus on Ukraine's defense amid eroding support for Kyiv in the West and swelling distractions like conflict in the Middle East.\nAndriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president\u2019s chief of staff, and Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis are hosting Sunday's conference attended by more than 80 delegations that aims to build on the previous closed-door efforts in Denmark, Saudi Arabia and Malta last summer and fall.\nZelenskyy has presented a 10-point peace formula that, among other things, seeks the expulsion of all Russian forces from Ukraine \u2014 at a time when both sides are fighting from largely static positions along a roughly 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) front line.\nRussian forces have recently stepped up missile and drone attacks that have stretched Ukraine\u2019s air defense resources, leaving the country vulnerable in the 22-month war unless it can secure further weapons supplies.\n\u201cThe war is far from over and peace is still nowhere in sight,\" the Swiss department of foreign affairs said in a statement previewing Sunday's talks.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Top Western envoys review Ukraine peace formula to end Russia's war as Zelenskyy plans Davos visit", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-davos-ukraine-russia-switzerland-b2478364.html"}
