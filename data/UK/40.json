The other two have not been identified\nSanders mother, Oneida Oliver-Sanders, said, 'I just can\u2019t believe I\u2019ll never be able to hug and kiss my baby again. Life is so unfair. I just want my baby'\nSanders graduated from Ware County High School in 2017\nAs of Sunday morning, Iran - the main backer of anti-Israel group Hezbollah - and its proxies are the main suspects, officials said.\nThe Wall Street Journal has reported that the US failed to stop the attack because the enemy drone approached its target at the same time as a US drone returning to base and the two were confused.\nModern military aircraft, naval vessels and ground vehicles are fitted with technology known as Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Transponders, which identify 'friendly' vehicles.\nIt's unclear whether the system in use at the Jordan base malfunctioned or if human error was involved.\nThe suicide drone was launched by from Iraq by a militia backed by Tehran, according to US officials, and hit the base which sits close to the borders of both Iraq and Syria.\nPresident Joe Biden vowed 'we shall respond' to a suicide drone strike that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan late on Saturday night.\nBiden issued a statement on Sunday mourning the loss of the slain service members - the latest casualty as the unrest in the Middle East persists.\n'Today, America's heart is heavy. Last night, three U.S. service members were killed - and many wounded - during an unmanned aerial drone attack on our forces stationed in northeast Jordan near the Syria border,' Biden said.\n'While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq.'\nHe added how the three fallen soldiers 'embodied the very best of our nation' and declared they died 'risking their own safety for the safety of their fellow Americans, and our allies and partners with whom we stand in the fight against terrorism.'\nMoffett's mother, Regina RaMo, said, 'This is one of the saddest days of my life. With a heavy heart I have to say that my Angel my first born has going on to be with GOD today'\nAll three soldiers were assigned to the 718th Engineer Company, a US Army Reserve unit based out of Fort Moore, Georgia\n'It is a fight we will not cease,' Biden, 81, proclaimed.\nWhile not identifying the militants responsible, the statement confirmed the strike was the work of anti-Western jihadists operating somewhere in the region.\nThe suicide strike comes as conflict in the war-torn region continues to escalate, with the war between Israel and Hamas terrorists in Gaza still ongoing, and Iran currently exchanging airstrikes with U.S. ally Pakistan.\nBoth countries, as of Sunday, boast a bevy of Iran-aligned militias, including Hezbollah and several other Shia militant groups.\nSince the Syrian War in 2011, Iran has also backed multiple Palestinian terror groups based in Gaza, and various terrorist groups in Bahrain and elsewhere across the Middle East.\nIn 2019, the nuclear-capable country acknowledged the involvement of the force in the Iraq and Syria conflicts, spurring the US to designate the Iranian army as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\nIran has also been known regional militant and proxy groups to achieve deniability in such strikes, as well as shield it from accountability for its destabilizing policies.\nThe country is also currently embroiled in an artillery-laden game of chicken with its own neighbor in Pakistan, which is one of NATO's main allies in the Middle East.\nJust last week, Pakistan's air force launched retaliatory airstrikes on two alleged militant positions in Iran, days after an Iranian airstrike killed two children in their own country.\nThe air attacks in Sistan and Baluchestan province killed at least seven - and added to tensions already present between the two nations and the region as a whole.\nAn outspoken enemy of both the US and Israel, Iran currently trains the Hezbollah militia group (seen here in Baghdad in 2019), which for years has sought to join the Palestinian cause. The group has not been named as responsible for Saturday's attack\nA few weeks ago, Pakistan recalled its ambassador to Tehran because of Tuesday's strikes by Iran inside Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan province. Iran claimed it targeted bases for a militant Sunni separatist group.\nIt drew strong condemnation from Pakistan, which denounced the attack as a 'blatant violation' of its airspace and said it killed two children.\nIf Marhamati's account of the casualties is correct, the country duplicated Pakistan's minor-killing offense at least two fold.\nAs Iranians continue to assess the full scope of the attack, the war more than a thousand miles west in Israel continues to rage.\nAnother 1,000 miles southwest, four fresh strikes were carried out by the US on Yemen, targeting anti-ship ballistic missiles used by another rebel group backed by Iran, the Houthi.\nEarlier in the month, shortly after Iran's attack on Pakistani soil, the group warned that British and American ships in the Red Sea have now become 'legitimate targets', given the state of the greater conflict.\nThe Houthis have since targeted ships in the region sporadically, with the attacks ramping up recently.\nIn response, the US launched Operation Prosperity Guardian - an international coalition to safeguard the region, with many other countries, including Spain and the UK, taking part.\nA reported 1,200 commercial ships have passed through the sea since the operation was launched on December, with none hit by drone or missile strikes until the first phase of the Sunday strike, when militants attacked the Hangzhou with several missiles.\nThe Sunday attack shows the group's continued resolve to support Hamas, which Israel recently pledged to continue to try to eradicate.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "PICTURED: Three American soldiers killed in early-morning suicide drone strike on base in Jordan", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13020295/Kennedy-Ladon-Sanders-identified-drone-strike-jordan.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"}
