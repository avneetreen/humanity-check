'Hezbollah has threatened to attack US interests in the Middle East.'\nHe added that ISIS is 'seeking to capitalize on this moment, galvanize supporters' and Islamist extremists alone or in 'small groups' could use the war as 'inspiration' to plan attacks within the U.S.\nWray also warned of increasing Jewish hate crimes throughout the US and world.\n'The Jewish community is uniquely, uniquely targeted by pretty much every terrorist organization across the spectrum,' he said.\n'When you look at a group that makes up 2.4 percent roughly of the American population, it should be jarring to everyone that that same population accounts for something like 60 percent of all religious-based hate crimes. And so they need our help.'\nMeanwhile Israel's Defense Force is pushing deeper into Gaza in its bloody campaign to eradicate Hamas and end its 16-year rule over the Palestinian territory after an October 7 attack that killed some 1,400 Israelis.\nSmoke rises from inside Northern Gaza on October 31, 2023 as seen from Sderot, Israel. As Israel's response to Hamas's Oct 7 attacks entered its fourth week\nIDF ground forces and tanks operating in Gaza in undated footage. The footage was released by IDF on Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2023\nThe Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected calls for a cease fire as airstrikes land near hospitals where thousands of Palestinians shelter beside the wounded. Tanks and other armored vehicles are pushing into the territory and according to the Palestinian Health Ministry some 8,000 Gaza residents have been killed.\nHamas is believed to be holding around 240 captives. The militant group has released four hostages and has said it would let the others go in return for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\nCongress is now under pressure to pass Israel aid. The White House has requested a $100 billion package that includes aid for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.\nBut the House has proposed a $14 billion bill that offers aid to only Israel. That funding would be offset by taking it from additional IRS funding that was included in the Democrat-passed Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe House bills is unlikely to find an appetite in the Senate, but Speaker Mike Johnson has insisted Israel funding must be offset and stand alone.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "FBI Director warns Hamas attack on Israel could inspire terrorism on AMERICAN soil: Christopher Wray says Hezbollah has also attempted operations in the U.S. in bleak prediction", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12693611/FBI-Director-Wray-warns-MULTIPLE-open-investigations-individuals-connections-Hamas-says-Iran-backed-Hezbollah-attempted-operations-US.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"}
