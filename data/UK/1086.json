However, Mr Sa'ar thinks a \"temporary short ceasefire\" could be granted in \"order to get our hostages out\".\nHe told UK-based Jewish News: \"There are ongoing negotiations to achieve that. And it will be achieved. We will see a temporary ceasefire.\"\nHis opinion seemingly clashes with what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier in the conflict, when he ruled out a five-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of the more than 230 hostages being held by Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip.\nMr Sa'ar's interview comes as the war has entered its 40th day, during which the IDF entered the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City after claiming it has evidence Hamas uses a structure underneath the building as a command centre.", "source_domain": "www.express.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Fighters in Gaza could be on brink of ceasefire as brutal conflict enters day 40", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1835133/israel-hamas-live-gaza-al-shifa-hospital"}
