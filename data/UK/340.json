The most dangerous flashpoint is generally believed to be Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon, where lethal clashes between the powerful Shia militia Hezbollah and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have greatly intensified in recent days.\nSporadic Israeli airstrikes inside Syria, repeated limited attacks by Islamist militants on US bases in Iraq and US reprisal raids \u2013 such as that ordered by the president, Joe Biden, on Tuesday \u2013 fuel the narrative of an approaching, broader conflagration. Drone and missile attacks on Red Sea shipping by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, explicitly launched in support of Hamas and the Palestinians, are adding to the angst.\nYet, so far at least, the much prophesied regional explosion has not occurred. There are two principal reasons for this. One is that Israel\u2019s war cabinet, led by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, having reportedly initially contemplated simultaneous assaults on Hamas and Hezbollah after 7 October, was dissuaded by US pressure. Since then, Israel\u2019s official position has been that the destruction of Hamas in Gaza is its foremost priority.\nThe second reason stems from a calculation by Iran\u2019s hardline conservative leadership that its interests are best served by keeping the war at arm\u2019s length. Hamas, Hezbollah and the Syrian, Iraqi and Yemeni groups are all Iran\u2019s proxies, armed, equipped, trained and, despite denials, often directed by Tehran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). They, not Iranians, do the fighting. In this way, Iran wages war on Israel \u2013 but indirectly and, up to a point, deniably.\nThe immediate problem is that the strength of these two key factors, jointly encouraging mutual restraint, is degrading. Put more crudely, as the war approaches its fourth month, the gloves are coming off on both sides. This perception may explain the latest, frantic intervention by Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, who \u2013 echoing the UN general assembly \u2013 demanded a \u201clasting ceasefire\u201d in Gaza in talks with Netanyahu this week.\nIt also helps explain growing US, British and German emphasis on de-escalating, pausing and containing the Gaza mayhem. This is ostensibly prompted by concerns about more than 21,000 Palestinian deaths, as counted by Hamas, and what the UN decries as a humanitarian disaster. Yet western leaders, supposedly powerless to stop it, know the IDF\u2019s relentless, criminally indiscriminate, self-defeating Gaza killing spree has become an unbearable daily provocation to Israel\u2019s foes. The consequent looming spectre of a far-ranging regional explosion, not photos of dead and maimed Palestinian children, is what truly moves them.\nView image in fullscreen Tribal fighters in Sanaa, Yemen, recently enlisted by the Houthis in preparation for a potential conflict with Israel, 20 December 2023.

Mousavi was a big fish, in charge of coordinating Iran\u2019s dealings with Hezbollah and the Syrian regime. Iran has vowed to exact terrible retribution on Israel. But the killing sent another message, too.\n\u201cMousavi\u2019s death is viewed in the region as an Israeli signal that Iran can\u2019t continue enjoying immunity while promoting and funding anti-Israel terror by its agents. It also brings us closer to the possibility of an escalation with Hezbollah, and even with Iran, on the northern border,\u201d wrote Haaretz analyst Amos Harel. Under intense fire from Hezbollah, Israel\u2019s patience was wearing thin, he suggested. Benny Gantz, a senior war cabinet member, hinted Israel might soon invade Lebanon if the situation did not improve.\nEvidently, self-restraint and hands-off proxy warfare can only go so far. For its part, Tehran may be experiencing difficulty in holding back the Islamist militants it has succoured. Yemen\u2019s Houthis, for example, undeterred by the creation of a US-led international taskforce, have since stepped up maritime attacks. At least 50 drones and ballistic missiles have been aimed directly at Israel. It looks like a case of rogues going rogue.\nMeanwhile, Israel\u2019s leadership has taken to describing itself as already engaged in a \u201cmulti-front\u201d war \u2013 a claim pointing towards rapid real-time escalation. Yoav Gallant, the defence minister, told the Knesset this week that Israel was \u201ccoming under attack from seven theatres: Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Judea and Samaria [the West Bank], Iraq, Yemen and Iran\u201d. Israel was fighting back across the board, he said.\nOf these seven \u201cconflict zones\u201d, the Blue Line separating Israel and Lebanon is presently the most volatile, teetering \u2013 in the view of many in Jerusalem \u2013 on the brink of all-out war. \u201cMore and more people are accepting the idea that war with Hezbollah, maybe soon, is unavoidable,\u201d an un-named minister from Netanyahu\u2019s ruling Likud party told Haaretz.\nThere\u2019s another reason for believing escalation is now a very real danger: the far-from-fanciful consideration that a desperate, cornered, discredited and unpopular Netanyahu may welcome the prospect of Israel caught in a quasi-permanent state of war against all-comers. All-out conflict, depicted as existential in nature, would help silence his critics, stiffen the will and cohesion of his coalition government and deflect calls for his resignation and early elections.\nMore than this, a wider war without end, with Israel purposefully taking on Tehran\u2019s proxies, could open a path to the fulfilment of Netanyahu\u2019s oft-stated, oft-threatened ambition: to directly confront the Iranian regime itself and force a final settling of accounts with Israel\u2019s most dangerous foe \u2013 a fateful showdown for which he once demanded, and very nearly got, Donald Trump\u2019s help.\nWar without end could mean, in short, that Netanyahu survives while countless others doubtless would not. If he gets his way, Gaza may be just the beginning.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Amid fears of escalation in the Israel-Gaza conflict, consider this: war without end suits Netanyahu", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/29/israel-gaza-conflict-war-benjamin-netanyahu"}
