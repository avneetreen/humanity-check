The displacement follows orders from Israeli forces urging civilians to flee parts of Gaza where Israel says Hamas has a stronghold. The OCHA says the influx of people has made overcrowding worse and put pressure on limited resources. Speaking from Rafah in southern Gaza, the director of UNRWA, the UN\u2019s relief agency, Tom White told the BBC there are \u201cwell over a million people\u201d seeking safety in the city. As a consequence of overcrowding, White said thousands of people are sleeping outside \u201cunder flimsy pieces of plastic\u201d.\n31 Dec 2023 01.23 CET This blog is now closing and a new one will open later today, but for all of our latest updates \u2013 see our full coverage of the Israel-Gaza war, and a summary of the key events so far.\n30 Dec 2023 00.56 CET Summary Here is where things stand: The Organization for Islamic Cooperation has \u201cwelcomed\u201d South Africa\u2019s decision to launch a case at the International Court of Justice in which it accuses Israel of carrying out \u201cgenocidal\u201d acts across Gaza. According to Qatari news agency QNA, the 57-member OIC, which Qatar is a part of, stressed that Israel is \u201ccommitting a genocide by its indiscriminate targeting of civilian population \u2026 forcibly displacing them, preventing them from obtaining basic needs and humanitarian aid, and destroying buildings and health, educational and religious facilities\u201d.\nTim Kaine, a US Democratic senator representing Virginia, has condemned the Biden administration\u2019s arms transfer to Israel, joining a handful of other Democrats who are criticizing Biden for bypassing congressional review in the foreign transfer of weapons. Kaine\u2019s criticism comes as Israeli strikes have killed more than 21,600 Palestinians across Gaza since 7 October, while internally displacing more than 1.9 million survivors from their homes.\nThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Nentanyahu, said that the border zone between the Gaza Strip and Egypt should be under Israel\u2019s control. During a press conference on Saturday, Netanyahu said, \u201cThe Philadelphi corridor - or to put it more correctly, the southern stoppage point [of Gaza] - must be in our hands. It must be shut. It is clear that any other arrangement would not ensure the demilitarisation that we seek,\u201d Reuters reports.\nIn a tweet ahead , the World Food Programme warned that \u201cthere is a different kind of countdown in Gaza\u201d, pointing to an impending famine across the strip as a result of Israel\u2019s attacks. \u201cWe are racing against time to avert a complete collapse of even the most basic services and starvation for millions,\u201d the WFP said.\nIsraeli forces shot and killed a 22-year-old Palestinian man in the West Bank on Saturday, the Palestinian health ministry announced. The man, identified by Palestinian news agency WAFA as Mohammad Hussein Masalma, was killed by Israeli forces who fired live ammunition at the entrance of the al-Fawwar refugee camp in the south of Hebron, WAFA reports.\nPalestine\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Husam Zomlot, has hailed South Africa\u2019s decision to launch a case against Israel in the International Court of Justice in which it accused Israel of carrying out \u201cgenocidal\u201d acts in Gaza. In a tweet on Saturday, Zomlot wrote: \u201cJustice must be served and the #genocide must stop.\u201d\nThe Palestinian Liberation Front\u2019s armed wing announced on Saturday that an Israeli soldier it was holding captive had been killed in an Israeli airstrike, which also injured some of his captors, Reuters reports. According to an audio speech broadcast by Al Araby television, an Abu Ali Mustafa brigades spokesperson said that the Israeli airstrike occurred after a failed attempt by Israeli forces to rescue the soldier.\nForty percent of Gaza\u2019s population is at risk of famine, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency said on Saturday. \u201cEvery day is a struggle for survival, finding food and water,\u201d the UN agency for Palestinian refugees added.\nUpdated at 01.08 CET\n30 Dec 2023 00.32 CET Here are some images coming through the newswires from Gaza, where more than 21,600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes since 7 October and displaced survivors grapple with shortages of food, water, medical supplies and fuel: View image in fullscreen Palestinian people buy frozen meat that was allowed into the Gaza Strip at the butcher shops as Israeli attacks continue on 30 December 2023 in Rafah, Gaza.

It added that the OIC called on the International Court of Justice to \u201crespond swiftly and take urgent measures to put an end to the genocide committed by the Israeli occupation forces in the occupied Palestinian territory\u201d. South Africa\u2019s decision to file a case against Israel earlier this week comes as Israeli strikes have killed more than 21,600 Palestinians across the densely populated Gaza strip \u2013 which human rights organizations have described as an \u201copen-air prison\u201d \u2013 since 7 October.\nUpdated at 00.43 CET\n30 Dec 2023 23.05 CET Tim Kaine, a US Democratic senator representing Virginia, has condemned the Joe Biden administration\u2019s arms transfer to Israel, joining a handful of other Democrats who are criticizing Biden for bypassing congressional review in the foreign transfer of weapons. Kaine\u2019s criticism comes as Israeli strikes have killed more than 21,600 Palestinians across Gaza since 7 October, while internally displacing more than 1.9 million survivors from their homes. The Guardian\u2019s Edward Helmore reports: Virginia senator Tim Kaine has added his voice to a rising chorus within the Democratic party questioning the Biden administration\u2019s legislatively unconstrained transfer of US munitions to Israel. In a news release on Saturday, the Democratic senator \u2013 a member of the Senate armed services committee \u2013 said weapons transfers must come under congressional oversight. \u201cJust as Congress has a crucial role to play in all matters of war and peace, Congress should have full visibility over the weapons we transfer to any other nation. Unnecessarily bypassing Congress means keeping the American people in the dark,\u201d Kaine wrote. \u201cWe need a public explanation of the rationale behind this decision \u2013 the second such decision this month,\u201d he added. On Friday, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had approved the sale of 155mm projectiles and related equipment valued at $147.5m, an increase from an earlier approved order for tens of thousands of rounds of the heavy artillery munitions.

During a press conference on Saturday, Netanyahu said, \u201cThe Philadelphi corridor - or to put it more correctly, the southern stoppage point [of Gaza] - must be in our hands. It must be shut.

He went on to threaten to attack Iran directly over the exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border, saying, \u201cIf Hezbollah expands the warfare, it will suffer blows that it has not dreamed of - and so too Iran.\u201d\nUpdated at 23.12 CET\n30 Dec 2023 20.26 CET With more than 21,600 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since 7 October, Israel forces have expanded their ground operations across the strip, where more than 1.9 million surviving Palestinians have been displaced as a result. The Guardian\u2019s Emma Graham-Harrison reports: Israeli planes bombed refugee camps in Gaza on Saturday as troops expanded ground operations and tens of thousands of Palestinians fled their homes, setting the stage for a new year as bloody and destructive as the last three months of 2023. The threat of wider escalation also looms large over the region, as skirmishes on the northern boundary with Lebanon intensify, and Israeli officials have hinted that the \u201cdiplomatic hourglass\u201d is running out to reach a negotiated solution. For now there seems little hope of even a temporary break in attacks, even after Egypt hosted leaders for talks this week and pushed plans for a staged break in the war. A senior Hamas official told AP on Saturday they are firm in their position that there will be no hostage releases without a permanent ceasefire. Israel will not accept ending a war its leaders describe as existential and \u201cwithout limit\u201d. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says Hamas must be destroyed after the brutal attacks of 7 October, when gunmen broke into Israel and murdered 1,200 people, the majority civilians. The scale of death and suffering inside Gaza has isolated Israel internationally, with even allies like the UK now calling for a \u201csustainable ceasefire\u201d. More than 21,600 people have been killed in Gaza, the majority women and children, and thousands more buried under the rubble, health authorities in the Hamas-run strip say.
