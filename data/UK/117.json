That\u2019s the question a new documentary sparking conversation at the Sundance film festival chillingly poses, arguing that US government and military officials must brace for the possibility of a potential political coup in a divided America.\nWar Game, directed by Jesse Moss and Tony Gerber, observes a closed-door, unscripted simulation of an armed attack on the Capitol based on the events of 6 January 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters and far-right insurrectionists stormed the building to disrupt lawmakers\u2019 certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election. The six-hour exercise asked a bipartisan group of US defense, intelligence and elected policymakers spanning five presidential administrations to role-play the administrative response to a political coup backed by rogue members of the US military in the wake of a contested election.\nThe exercise was developed by the Vet Voice Foundation, an organization helping military veterans in civic leadership and policy, to help US government officials practice responses to a January 6-level threat to democracy and understand the threat of extremism from within the military. The film notes that one in five criminal defendants from the Capitol attack were military veterans.\nJanuary 6 \u201cdid not surprise those who follow far-right movement\u201d, says Kristofer Goldsmith, a combat veteran from the war in Iraq who developed the game\u2019s \u201cred cell\u201d of insurgents. War Game opens with footage of Goldsmith and his colleague Chris Jones scouting out Washington DC for how a potential social media and conspiracy theory-fueled mob attack would unfold. Both experts on domestic extremist movements, the two based their mock insurgency group, the Order of Columbus, on Q-Anon, Donald Trump\u2019s Maga movement and far-right groups involved in the Capitol attack, such as the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers.\nThe war game, held at a hotel in Washington DC in January 2023, imagines a fictional 6 January 2025, in which the Order of Columbus has called an attack on Congress to prevent the certification of President Hotham (played by the former Montana governor Steve Bullock) after a contested election. Bullock\u2019s president, in a war room with several advisors, intelligence officers and military heads, must decide how to respond to an escalating series of threats including: the storming of the Capitol aided by rogue national guard members, disinformation on social media and coordinated uprisings on several state capitols. They must contend with messages from a Trump-like rival candidate inciting more violence, and a video from a high-ranking general, based on the former Trump official and Stop the Steal rally speaker Michael Flynn, calling on the military to disobey the commander in chief.\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Sundance\nThe point of the exercise is to \u201cthink about the unthinkable\u201d, says Benjamin Radd, a game producer who recalls living through Iran\u2019s 1979 revolution as a child, in which stability and institutional authority collapsed. Do you respond with a strong show of force? How much force? Focus on messaging? When do things get dire enough to justify invoking the Insurrection Act, a law allowing the president to use the US military on its own citizens, considered the game\u2019s nuclear option.\nThat\u2019s in part because of its potential for abuse in the wrong hands. The film notes that Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers, personally implored Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act to prevent the certification of Biden\u2019s election, and promised that the Oath Keepers would support him if he did. \u201cYou must use the Insurrection Act and use the power of presidency to stop him. All us veterans will support you,\u201d he wrote. Rhodes, a Yale-educated former paratrooper who founded the far-right group (including current and retired military personnel, law enforcement officers and first responders) in 2009, was convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in the Capitol attack.\nThe 94-minute film also features interviews with game producers and participants on what motivated them to fight domestic extremism, and how seriously they view the country\u2019s vulnerability to potentially violent, anti-democratic factions. All it takes is a \u201ctiny fraction\u201d of enlisted service people who believe \u201cthis conspiracy, this cult, this religion\u201d to \u201cpose a serious security threat\u201d, says Goldsmith, who is particularly concerned about the recruitment of disillusioned, isolated veterans to far-right movements.\n\u201cWishing that it\u2019s just going to go away? It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d says Linda L Singh, a retired major general of the Maryland army national guard, on extremist beliefs in the armed forces.\nThe film stresses that while a political coup attempt is by no means likely in the near future, it is important to remember that the US has no built-in immunity to one. The repeated message is: it can happen here. \u201cIs it probable? Probably not,\u201d says Heidi Heitkamp, a former senator from North Dakota playing a senior advisor to Bullock\u2019s president. \u201cIs it possible? Absolutely.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018Think about the unthinkable\u2019: could the US handle an even worse January 6?", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/22/war-game-documentary-sundance-january-6"}
