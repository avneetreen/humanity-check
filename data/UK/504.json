Where our commanders consider it necessary to stick to active defenses they are doing so, and we are improving our positions where it's needed.\u201d\nThe Russian leader hailed the troops for repelling Ukrainian attacks during the summer counteroffensive.\n\u201cThe enemy has suffered heavy casualties and to a large extent wasted its reserves while trying to show at least some results of its so-called counteroffensive to its masters,\u201d Putin said, adding that \u201dthe myth about invulnerability of Western weapons also has collapsed.\"\n\u201cAll attempts by the West to deliver us a military defeat, a strategic defeat, were shattered by the courage and fortitude of our soldiers, the growing might of our armed forces and the potential of our military industries,\u201d Putin said.\nDuring the counteroffensive that began in early June, Ukrainian forces have failed to make any significant gains as they faced multiecheloned Russian defensive lines, including sprawling minefields.\nSpeaking at the same meeting, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that the Russian minefields spread for 7,000 kilometers (more than 4,300 miles).\nShoigu said that 650,000 Russian soldiers have received combat experience in Ukraine, turning the Russian army into \u201cthe best prepared and capable army in the world, armed with advanced weapons that have been tested in combat.\u201d\n\u201cDespite the sanctions, we produce more high-tech weapons than NATO countries,\u201d Shoigu said.\nHe declared that the Russian arms industries have increased the output of tanks by 5.6 times, the number of drones built by 16.8 times and bolstered the production of artillery munitions by 17.5 times since the start of what the Kremlin calls \u201cthe special military operation\u201d in Ukraine.\nShoigu said the military has received more than 1,500 new and modernized tanks, more than 2,500 armored infantry vehicles and 237 new planes and helicopters.\nWhile hailing the military's performance, Putin noted the need to improve military communications, streamline the use of intelligence and counterartillery means, and increase supplies of precision munitions and drones. He added that Russia also needs to expand the capability of its satellite assets.\nPutin particularly emphasized the importance of bolstering the country's nuclear forces, saying that their role has increased amid \u201cthe changing character of military threats and the emergence of new military-political risks.\u201d\nPutin reaffirmed his long-held argument that he sent Russian troops into Ukraine to counter security threats to Russia posed by Western plans to incorporate the country in NATO. Ukraine and its Western allies have denounced the move by Moscow as an unprovoked act of aggression.\nShoigu charged that military personnel from NATO countries operate Ukraine\u2019s air defense systems, multiple rocket launchers and tactical missile systems and also help plan military operations and train troops. He didn't provide specifics to support his claim.\n\u201cThe West isn't abandoning its strategy of containment of Russia and its aggressive goals in Ukraine,\u201d Putin said. \"Well, we also aren't going to abandon the goals of the special military operation.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Putin hails Russia's military performance in Ukraine and he vows to achieve Moscow's goals", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/vladimir-putin-ap-ukraine-russia-sergei-shoigu-b2466580.html"}
