They\u2019re the same type of elite group and they got the assignment to break first and clear the way for the forces.\"\nThe IDF now says troops killed Ahmed Musa, a Nukhba company commander, and Amr Alhandi, a Nukhba platoon commander in a ground operation.\nThe terrorists were said to be holed up in Jabalia, The Times of Israel reports.\nMusa was reportedly one of the Hamas commanders who led the assault on the Zikim base, the nearby Kibbutz, and another army post in the area on October 7.\n\u201cIn recent days Ahmed Musa led offensive activity against IDF forces in the west Jabalia area,\u201d the IDF said.\nThe Israel Defense Forces added troops also killed Muhammed Kahlout, the head of Hamas\u2019s so-called sniper array in the terror group\u2019s northern Gaza brigade.\nIt comes after Israel last month vowed to destroy Nukhba with a wave of strikes on the commando group.\n\u201cOvernight, the IAF conducted a wave of strikes targeting the Nukhba elite forces of the Hamas terrorist organisation, by striking operational command centres used by operatives who infiltrated the communities surrounding the Gaza Strip last Saturday,\u201d an IDF spokesman said.\nVideo footage released by the IDF showed a barracks-like structure being engulfed in a massive explosion.\nIt comes after an Israeli airstrike pounded Hamas' terror headquarters to clear civilians from a Gaza hospital.\nFootage appeared to show the scenes of despair near the Indonesian Hospital as Israel carries out \"pressure cooker\" bombings.\nSuch bombardment operations include steadily increasing fire on a building in which armed targets are holed up.\nUsing increasingly heavy weaponry, from more and more angles, the bombing keeps going until they either surrender or the building caves in on them.\nThe IDF has said it did not target the Indonesian Hospital, where there were reports of explosions yesterday.\n\"The IDF did not target the hospital,\" it said.\n\"The IDF does not target civilians and operates in accordance with international law.\"\n7 The ruined remains of a building in the kibbutz attacks on the deadly October 7 attacks Credit: AP\n7 Petrified festival goers ran for their lives as Hamas terrorists attacked hundreds on the same day Credit: TikTok\n7 Israel last month vowed to destroy Nukhba and its terror soldiers with a wave of strikes Credit: Rex", "source_domain": "www.thesun.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Israel wipes out Hamas commando unit \u2018Elite\u2019 who were ordered to \u2018kill everyone & burn houses\u2019 in October 7 massacre", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24693871/israel-hamas-nukhba-forces-eliminated-idf/"}
