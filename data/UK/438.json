Commercial aircraft is expected to remain the largest segment of the market over the next five years and is also expected to experience the highest growth during the same period. Within the A380 airframe, thermoplastic composites account for more than 1,000 individual part numbers, representing a mass of more than 5,000 lb/2.27 metric tons or about 7.5% of the aircraft's total composite airframe flyaway weight. Thermoplastic composites are also used to provide localized reinforcement between some of the fuselage frames, in the form of shear webs, on the 787 (about 150 per aircraft). On average, about 8,000 clips are used in an A350XWB aircraft, whereas there are 10,000 to 15,000 such clips and cleats in a B787 aircraft.\nBased on the resin type - The A&D thermoplastic composites market is segmented into PPS-based composites, PEEK-based composites, PEI-based composites, and other composites. PEEK is estimated to maintain its huge dominance in the market. Key advantages that drive its usage in the A&D industry are weight reduction, excellent strength, and chemical resistance at elevated temperatures, and lower brittleness than PPS resin. PEEK is often used with carbon fiber to fabricate clips, cleats, brackets, clamps, and connectors.\nBased on the application type - The market is segmented into interior, airframe, and others. Airframe holds a giant share of the market with a good level of thermoplastic composite penetration in the application segment. Key application areas in the airframe segment are clips, cleats, leading edges, panels for the fuselage, shear webs, stringers, ribs, rudders, and elevators. There is also growing interest in thermoplastic composites in interiors with floor panels, brackets, profiles, and seat backs being key applications.\nBased on the fiber type - The market is segmented into carbon fiber composites and glass fiber composites. Carbon fiber composite is estimated to maintain its huge dominance in the market in the foreseen future. Excellent weight reduction, a high strength-to-weight ratio, a high tensile and compressive strength, a low coefficient of thermal expansion, and high fatigue resistance are some key advantages that drive the segment's market. On the other hand, glass fiber composite holds a niche market with good prevalence in interior applications where it meets desired performance.\nBased on the process type - The market is segmented as compression molding, bagging, and injection molding. Compression molding is expected to remain the dominant process type in the market during the forecast period. Compression molding offers faster part cycle time, reduced part waste, and reduced defects, which overall lead to lower costs. By monitoring the temperature during the molding process, quality and process consistency also improve.\nTo know the attractive segments, click here for a free sample pdf:\nhttps://www.stratviewresearch.com/Request-Sample/299/aerospace-&-defense-thermoplastic-composites-market.html#form\nWhich Region Offers the Best Opportunity and Growth?\nThe report suggests that Europe is expected to remain the largest market over the next five years.\nThis growth is majorly attributed to the following \u2013\nGermany , France , and the UK are the leading markets in the region.\n, , and the UK are the leading markets in the region. Airbus is the major consumer of thermoplastic composites.\nMajor tier players have set up manufacturing plants in high proximity to Airbus' assembly plants to fulfill their emerging requirements for its next-generation aircraft programs.\nLikewise, North America also holds a reasonable share in the A&D thermoplastic composites market. Boeing and Gulfstream Aerospace are the key OEMs, which are creating a healthy demand for thermoplastic composite parts in the region.\nAerospace & Defense Thermoplastic Composites Market Drivers\nSome of the key drivers listed in the report are given below.\nIncreasing penetration of composites in modern aircraft programs.\nLow processing costs coupled with the advantage of recyclability of thermoplastic composites over thermoset composites.\nThe recovering Aerospace & Defense industry.\nFor Customization or Any Other Queries, Get in Touch with Our Industry Experts at sales@stratviewresearch.com\nTop 5 Companies in the Aerospace & Defense Thermoplastic Composites Market?\nThe market is fairly consolidated with the presence of some global and regional players.
