The announcement by the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, on Tuesday follows the security council\u2019s adoption of a resolution on Friday requesting him to expeditiously appoint a senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, where more than 2 million civilians are in desperate need of food, water and medicine, the Associated Press reports. Guterres said Kaag, who speaks fluent Arabic and five other languages, \u201cbrings a wealth of experience in political, humanitarian and development affairs as well as in diplomacy\u201d to her new post. She is expected to start on 8 January. \u201cShe will facilitate, coordinate, monitor, and verify humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza,\u201d he said, adding that Kaag will also establish a UN mechanism to accelerate aid deliveries \u201cthrough states which are not party to the conflict\u201d.

It blamed the widespread hunger on insufficient aid entering Gaza. Israel stopped all deliveries of food, water, medicine and fuel into the territory after the militant Hamas group\u2019s 7 October rampage in southern Israel which killed about 1,200 people. The Israel-Gaza war has so far killed more than 20,900 people in Gaza, according to its Hamas-run health ministry. After US pressure, Israel allowed a trickle of aid in through Egypt, but UN agencies say that for weeks only 10% of food needs has been entering Gaza. Last week, Israel opened the Kerem Shalom crossing into the territory and truck traffic increased but an Israeli strike on Thursday morning on the Palestinian side of the crossing stopped aid pickups, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said.

Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, Yoav Gallant said Israel was \u201ccoming under attack from seven theatres: Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Judea and Samaria [an Israeli term for the West Bank], Iraq, Yemen and Iran\u201d. \u201cWe have already responded and taken action in six of these theatres,\u201d he told the Knesset, without specifying.

The IDF soldiers were evacuating a civilian who had been injured in an earlier Hezbollah attack on a church, the army said. One of the soldiers was in a \u201cserious condition\u201d, it said. The Israeli army said that in the earlier attack, the missile had hit a Greek Orthodox church in Iqrit, referring to an abandoned Palestinian Christian village whose inhabitants were forced to leave during the 1948 war and creation of Israel, AFP reported.

In a statement from his ministry, Ben-Gvir said he did not have enough faith in Perry to allow her to continue in her current position, the Jerusalem Post reported. The Israeli minister also accused Perry of having conducted negotiations with imprisoned Hamas militants on the terms of their incarceration, the Times of Israel reported. In response, a statement from Perry said: An unsurprising decision by an irresponsible minister that combines unfounded and baseless claims, a detachment from reality and childishness that show his lack of understanding of the prisons service. Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz\u2019s National Unity party also responded to the announcement, warning that replacing senior officials \u201cat this time harms the functioning of the country during a time of war and is not right\u201d.\nUpdated at 21.05 CET", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "UN names Netherlands\u2019 Sigrid Kaag aid coordinator for Gaza - as it happened", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/dec/26/israel-gaza-war-live-updates-hamas-palestinians-deaths-idf-strikes-un"}
