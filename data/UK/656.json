The other side read: 'Stop killing children.'\nElsewhere, video was shared of a protester with a microphone and amplifier calling for 'victory to the intifada' during the protest; 'intifada' is an Arabic word referring to a rebellion, uprising or resistance movement.\nThe Metropolitan Police has asked for the public's help in identifying a woman carrying a sign comparing the IDF's treatment of Palestinians to Holocaust victims\nThe sign compared a scene of Nazis preparing to execute Jewish men and boys to the IDF's capture and stripping of Palestinians\nVictory to the intifada, apparently.

Is that appropriate?' She appears to acknowledge his questions but does not respond further.\nHe also attempted to bring the sign to the attention of police officers monitoring the rally. The Met says the officers did not stop to engage with him because they were following the woman holding the sign.\nIn a series of tweets, the force said: 'We are appealing for the public's help to identify the woman below as part of an investigation into a placard carried at the protest earlier today. We would also appeal to the woman to come forward.'\nIt later added: 'The officers didn\u2019t stop because as the video was being filmed, they were already following the person holding the placard while waiting for other officers to reach them. That was their focus.\n'The density of the crowd meant that they ultimately lost sight of her prior to other officers arriving. We are now appealing for the public\u2019s help to identify her, or for her to come forward.\nThe photograph on the right was shared by Israeli media and shows IDF troops rounding up a number of Palestinian men who had been stripped to their underwear.\nWhen asked about the images, IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari seemed to confirm that the men had been taken prisoner but did not clarify whether those pictured were members of Hamas or civilians.\nHe suggested that the men had been stripped to make sure they were not carrying weapons; they were believed to have surrendered in the Jabalia refugee camp and other areas around northern Gaza.\nThe origin of the image on the left has never been fully ascertained, but is believed to show naked Jewish men and boys being rounded up by German police following the invasion of Poland in 1939.\nOne example was been captioned: 'Photograph of the abuse of Jews before execution, Sniatyn, Poland (now Ukraine), 11/05/1943'. An investigation carried out by the Guardian in 2004 was unable to confirm the story behind the picture but it forms part of several collections of Holocaust historical material around the world.\nElsewhere, a man was heard encouraging people to chant 'victory to the intifada' as he marched through central London with a microphone and amplifier.\n'We can't stop until Palestine is free...we can only stop when imperialism has been crushed and the imperialists defeated under the boot of the people.\n'That is the only way we will win and we can never stop until that day.'\nHe added: 'That's why we say: From London, to Gaza.' Others responded: 'Victory to the intifada.'\n'Intifada' is an Arabic word that in this context refers to the uprising of the Palestinian people against Israeli occupation.\nPolice detain a person during the pro-Palestine march in central London on Saturday.
