Al-Naouq called him from London. The words that spilled from the other end of the line landed like world-shattering blows: Airstrike. Everyone killed.\nFour nights later, Ammar al-Butta was startled from sleep in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis when the wall of his bedroom collapsed over him. A missile had pierced his top-floor apartment and exploded one floor below.\nHe lurched over the rubble, shining the light of his cellphone into the wreckage, calling out to his 16 relatives.\n\u201cAnyone there?\u201d he cried. There was only silence.\nEntire generations of Palestinian families in the besieged Gaza Strip \u2014 from great-grandparents to infants only weeks old \u2014 have been killed in airstrikes in the Israel-Hamas war, in which the Israeli army says it aims to root out the militant group from the densely populated coastal territory.\nAttacks are occurring at a scale never seen in years of Israel-Hamas conflict, hitting residential areas, schools, hospitals, mosques and churches, even striking areas in southern Gaza where Israeli forces ordered civilians to flee.\nIsrael says the goal of the war is to destroy Hamas following the militant group\u2019s deadly Oct. 7 rampage in southern Israel that killed at least 1,200 people, and it maintains that the attacks target militant operatives and infrastructure.\nIt blames the high death toll \u2014 more than 11,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry \u2014 on Hamas, saying the group endangers civilians by operating among the population and in tunnels underneath civilian areas. Israel says the death toll includes Hamas fighters.\nBut the scope of the destruction and loss of life in Gaza, with entire families wiped out in a single strike, has raised troubling questions about Israeli military tactics.\nGENERATIONS LOST\nIt would take many hours of horror and mayhem before the truth would settle like the ash from the Oct. 20 explosion that leveled al-Naouq\u2019s family's home: 21 relatives killed.\nThey included his 75-year old father, two brothers, three sisters and their 13 children.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this actually happened,\u201d al-Naouq, a graduate student in London, told The Associated Press. \u201cBecause if I calculate what it means, I will be destroyed.\u201d\nHis father, Nasri, had recently told him that his sister Aya\u2019s home was destroyed in northern Gaza and she was staying with them in the central city of Deir al-Balah, south of the area Israel had ordered Palestinians to leave.\nA home can be rebuilt, al-Naouq recalled replying, all that matters is that she and the children are alive.\nBut just hours later, they were all dead: Wala'a, the most accomplished of the al-Naouq children with a degree in engineering, and her four children; Alaa and her five children; Aya, known for her wry sense of humor, and her three children; older brother Muhammed; and younger brother Mahmoud, who was preparing to travel to Australia for graduate studies when the war broke out.\nNine of the 21 are still under the rubble; dire fuel shortages prevented civil defense crews from digging them out.\nIdentifying the dead was another traumatizing endeavor; many bodies were unrecognizable, most were in pieces.\nAl-Naouq\u2019s sister, Doaa, who was not in the house at the time of the strike, told him she couldn\u2019t bear the smell of the rotting flesh of their loved ones under the rubble. Someone showed her body parts retrieved from the site and told her it was one of their sisters.\nThere were two survivors: Shimaa, al-Naouq\u2019s sister-in-law, and Omar, his 3-year-old nephew. His 11-year old niece, Malaka, was taken to al-Aqsa hospital with severe burns but died after doctors gave her ICU bed to another patient with a better chance of survival, his sister Doaa said.\nDoctors have to make extraordinarily difficult triage decisions, and severely wounded patients are being left to die because of shortages of beds, medical supplies and fuel, said Dr. Mohammed Qandeel, in Nasser Hospital, Gaza\u2019s second-largest.\n\u201cWe leave most as we don\u2019t have ventilators or beds,\u201d he said of patients in need of intensive care with complicated blast wounds. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached full collapse.\u201d\nCOMPETING CLAIMS\nIsrael doesn't say how it chooses targets in densely populated Gaza. But Israeli officials say many strikes on homes are based on intelligence assessments that wanted Hamas operatives are inside. Though it gives few details, Israel says every airstrike is reviewed by legal experts to ensure they comply with international law.\nMany Gaza families deny any Hamas targets were operating from their homes.\nThe Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but says a majority of Palestinians killed have been minors and women, about 4,500 and 2,200 respectively. At least 304 families have lost at least 10 relatives; about 31 families have lost over 30, according to a Nov. 6 health ministry report. That number is likely higher now as intense Israeli bombardment has continued.\nAmong the families with the highest number of casualties, many have been children.\nThe al-Astal family lost 89 relatives, 18 of them children under the age of 10, including three babies not yet a year old, according to an Oct. 26 ministry report. The Hassouna family had 74 killed, including 22 children ranging in age from 1 to 10 years old, it said. The Najjars lost 65 relatives: Nine were under 10 years old and 13 were under 4.\nAmmar al-Butta says his relatives were all civilians with no links to Hamas.\nThe Saqallah family, his cousins known for their sweet shops in Gaza City, had taken shelter with al-Butta\u2019s family in their four-story house in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, heeding Israeli evacuation orders.\nThe family arrived with trays of confections for their hosts. Joking with his cousins in the family\u2019s living room was a rare moment of respite in the fog of war and displacement, the 29-year-old teacher said.\nOne cousin, Ahmed Saqallah, 42, spoke of rebuilding his family's bomb-damaged home and looked forward to fixing the plumbing and painting.\n\u201cSimple, sweet dreams,\u201d al-Butta said.\nTen days later all 16 Saqallahs, from 69-year old Nadia to baby Asaad, not yet a year old, were killed in the Oct. 24 pre-dawn attack.\nUNANSWERED QUESTIONS\nA question left by al-Naouq in his family's WhatsApp group the night the blast leveled their home \u2014 \u201cTell me, how are you guys?\u201d \u2014 remains unanswered.\nThe distance has made the devastating news all the more surreal. Observing London\u2019s peaceful nights, where sounds of mirth resonate from restaurants and bars, al-Naouq imagines the airstrikes lighting Gaza\u2019s skies, the screams of panicked residents. His family, lying lifeless under the rubble.\nHe has no idea where his relatives' bodies are buried. There was no space in the hospital morgue to keep them. They could be in a mass grave, but al-Naouq has no way of knowing.\nAl-Butta said the Saqallah family was buried in his family grave in Khan Younis. The entire neighborhood mourned when they were interred. \u201cOur eyes are dry,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no tears left.\u201d\nIn the chaos of the war, taking account of the dead is a rushed, heart-rending process.\nIt begins with relatives scribbling the names of the dead and missing. They dig into the rubble with their hands, calling out for survivors. Hospitals later issue death certificates.\nGrieving relatives, who maintain no one in their households had links to Hamas, ask: Why them?\n\u201cWhy would they kill children and an old man?\u201d asked al-Naouq. \u201cWhat is the military justification for bombing my house? They were all civilians.\u201d\n\u201cI wish, one day, I can meet the one who pulled the trigger. I want to ask him: Why did you do it?\u201d\n___\nKullab reported from Baghdad.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Their families wiped out, grieving Palestinians in Gaza ask why", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-gaza-hamas-palestinians-israel-b2448239.html"}
