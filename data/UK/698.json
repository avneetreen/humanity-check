Earlier today, Benjamin Netanyahu announced that troops \u201care encircling Sinwar\u2019s house,\u201d adding that \u201che can escape, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before we get him.\u201d Sinwar, a founding member of Hamas, grew up in a refugee camp of Khan Younis. Asked whether Netanyahu\u2019s statement meant Israeli troops were closing in on the Sinwar home, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said: \u201cThe house of Sinwar is the area of Khan Younis.\u201d \u201cSinwar is not above ground; he is underground,\u201d Hagari said, adding: I don\u2019t want to elaborate where and how and what we know in terms of intelligence. This is not the place to talk about such things in the media. Our job is to find Sinwar and kill him.\n7 Dec 2023 02.58 CET Premature babies that were evacuated from Gaza are now being treated at a hospital in Egypt. Some of those images have been released.

We have talked to them about timetables. I don\u2019t want to share that because Israel has already kind of telegraphed precisely the location of its ground operation and I don\u2019t want to be the one telegraphing timetables\u2026 I will just say that we\u2019ve talked through with them what they\u2019re thinking in terms of the duration and how this falls into a longer-term strategy for addressing this issue that goes beyond just military means\n7 Dec 2023 01.47 CET In their daily update, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says there has been intense fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups. Here is some of their latest updates: Heavy Israeli bombardments from air, land, and sea across Gaza have continued on 5 and 6 December, alongside intense fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups, in particular in the eastern parts of Gaza city, Jabalia refugee camp, and areas east of Khan Younis. Rocket firing by Palestinian armed groups to Israel continued. OCHA has added that an area of Khan Younis city has been marked for immediate evacuation: On 6 December, an additional area in Khan Younis city encompassing about one square kilometre was designated by the Israeli military for immediate evacuation. Along with similar designations in previous days, about 25 per cent of the city area, where about 178,000 original residents (73 per cent of the population) and an estimated 170,000 IDPs [internally displaced persons] received have evacuations orders.

He will discuss with leaders there options to provide civilians in Gaza with more aid, how the UK can support the Palestinian Authority, the recovery of hostages, as well as efforts to prevent further escalation in the Middle East, Reuters reports. \u201cWe are working to find the best way to get aid and support to those in desperate need in the quickest and most direct route. That includes options by land, sea and air,\u201d Shapps said. Earlier this week Shapps said Britain was considering sending military support vessel RFA Lyme Bay to provide medical and humanitarian aid in the Middle East. Shapps is due to meet the Interior Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Gen Ziad Hab Al-Reeh, to discuss the need for measures to improve security for Palestinians in the West Bank, his office said, while in Tel Aviv he will meet Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant \u201cto address the current security situation and Israel\u2019s next steps\u201d.

The deadly conflict between Israel and Hamas militants has ignited tensions on many American college campuses, with protests flaring. At Harvard, donors have specifically called for President Claudine Gay to offer more explicit support for Israel, and condemnation of student groups who have voiced support for the Palestinian people. On Tuesday, Gay testified before the House Education Committee at a hearing dedicated to holding campus leaders accountable for antisemitic incidents. Republican lawmaker Elise Stefanik likened student calls for a new intifada \u2013 an Arabic word for uprising that harks back to the first Palestinian revolt against Israel in 1987 \u2013 to inciting \u201cgenocide against the Jewish people in Israel and globally.\u201d When Stefanik asked Gay if such calls would violate Harvard\u2019s code of conduct, the Harvard president said: \u201cWe embrace a commitment to free expression even of views that are objectionable, offensive, hateful. \u201cWhen speech crosses into conduct that violates our policies, including policies against bullying, harassment or intimidation, we take action.\u201d Stefanik called on Gay to immediately resign, while Republican Senator Ted Cruz called the comment \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d On Wednesday, Gay issued a brief statement clarifying her testimony. \u201cThere are some who have confused a right to free expression with the idea that Harvard will condone calls for violence against Jewish students,\u201d she said in a statement on social media. Let me be clear: Calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.\u201d\n6 Dec 2023 00.30 CET Reged Ahmad here, picking up the blog from Leonie Chao-Fong.

Posting to social media, Erdan said the UN chief had decided to activate \u201cthis rare clause only when it allows him to put pressure on Israel.\u201d He described the move as \u201cmore proof of the Secretary-General\u2019s moral distortion and his bias against Israel\u201d and said Guterres\u2019 call for a ceasefire was \u201cactually a call to keep Hamas\u2019 reign of terror in Gaza\u201d. He added: I again call on the secretary-general to resign immediately - the UN needs a secretary-general who supports the war on terror, not a secretary-general who acts according to the script written by Hamas. Today, the Secretary-General has reached a new moral low. He writes that he is activating, for the first time, Article 99 of the UN Charter in relation to the Israel-Hamas war, an article that can only be invoked in a situation where international peace and security are\u2026 pic.twitter.com/rQm18aT1vq \u2014 Ambassador Gilad Erdan \u05d2\u05dc\u05e2\u05d3 \u05d0\u05e8\u05d3\u05df (@giladerdan1) December 6, 2023", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israeli forces and Hamas fighting house-to-house battles in Gaza - as it happened", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/dec/06/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-palestinians-killed-gaza-strike-as-israeli-military-idf-fighting-khan-younis-news"}
