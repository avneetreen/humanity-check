Bob Good, R-Va., wrote on X in reaction.\n'They should be unconditionally reinstated and restored with full pay and benefits,' he continued.\nFormer Army officer Brad Miller said the letter does not go far enough to remedy the harm he experienced.\n'Why doesn't the Army ask me if I want my resignation converted into a retirement dated with the release date of this new policy, and along with it offer compensation for the command I was wrongly relieved of, compensation for the remainder of whatever my career might have been, and then offer me my adjusted pension from this month forward? Then offer the same to all others similarly wronged,' he stated.\nHe went on to say the Pentagon can't 'fix itself' and claimed Biden administration officials' loyalty is 'assuredly un-American.'\nRetired Air Force veteran Patrick Fox said the Army has entered 'panic mode' by sending the letter.\n'Given how politically radioactive this decision by the DoD was, how much resentment it generated internally, and how much bad press it generated when it as made - mollifying policy like this indicates Army leadership are feeling the pressure on recruitment numbers,' he wrote on X.\n'To a degree they're willing to eat a little crow on this to alleviate it. If it gets bad enough, and senior leadership are backed into a corner, promises to restore rank & pay are not unthinkable in the future.'\nA current Army officer told DailyMail.com that the Army has 'continued to miss the mark on taking care of its service members and veterans.'\n'For the veterans separated due to the mandate, it seems unnecessary that they should need to submit for a Discharge Characterization Upgrade after being unlawfully discharged,' he continued.\n'I believe the Army needs to make amends with the American People and take the first step in making things right for these former service members: the branch should automatically upgrade the discharge characterizations to Honorable as that was the true reflection of these individual\u2019s service to the Nation. This would also allow for veterans to make forward progression in the new chapter of their lives by being able to utilize their earned GI Bill,' the officer explained.\nDailyMail.com reached out to the Army for a response.\nOver 8,000 service members - many who sought religious exemptions - were fired for refusing to comply with the Pentagon's COVID-19 vaccine mandate enacted in August 2021.\nFollowing outrage over the mandate, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) passed in December 2022 terminated the mandate, but it did not reinstate service members who were fired for not receiving the shot nor provide any other compensation.\nAmendments by Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., that passed out of the House Armed Services Committee over the summer were included to 'offer redress' to service members who were 'unjustly discharged' by requiring the Pentagon to set up a reinstatement process and ensuring no negative retaliation.\nBut some current and former troops are saying that the amendments that would go into the FY 2024 NDAA are not strong enough to undo the 'serious harassment' they endured over the last two years.\nFrankman, who was in the Special Forces as part of the Green Berets, said that the 'missed career opportunities' he endured over the last two years could never be undone by any action of Congress.\nMy response to the Army\u2019s recent letter trying to bring back the unvaxxed soldiers it forced out and mistreated.\nFollow the tagged accounts to support DoD accountability. pic.twitter.com/LgYbWTNI8R \u2014 John Frankman (@johny_franks) November 20, 2023\nFollowing outrage, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) passed in December 2022 terminated the mandate\nAn active-duty Army officer told DailyMail.com that the fired troops have had 'their lives turned upside down and were betrayed by those charged with protecting them.'\nAnd a formal apology from their service branches would be key to be able to have trust restored, he added.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Army slammed for desperate attempt to win back favor with soldiers fired for refusing the COVID vaccine as the military enters 'panic mode' due to severe recruitment challenges", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12776347/Army-slammed-desperate-attempt-win-favor-soldiers-fired-refusing-COVID-vaccine-military-enters-panic-mode-severe-recruitment-challenges.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"}
