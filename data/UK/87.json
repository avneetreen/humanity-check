It is not known if anyone survived.\nAuthorities were investigating the cause of the crash, and a special military commission was on the way to the crash site, the Russian defence ministry said.\nRussian state news agency RIA Novosti, citing the ministry, reported that the POWs were being transported to the border region for a prisoner exchange.\nSpeaking on his morning call with reporters, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he could not comment on the crash as he did not have enough information about it.\nThe Russian air force has suffered a string of crashes that some observers have attributed to a higher number of flights amid the fighting in Ukraine.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a major Russian missile attack that was apparently devised to overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s air defences had killed 18 people and injured 130.\nToday, Russia launched around forty missiles of various types in an attempt to evade our air defenses. We were able to intercept the majority of them, but there were still some hits. Over 200 different objects were damaged. 130 residential buildings, all ordinary houses. 130\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Clep0GALtO \u2014 Volodymyr Zelenskyy / \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0417\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 (@ZelenskyyUa) January 23, 2024\nUkraine is marking the 700th day since the full-scale invasion by Kremlin\u2019s forces started.\nThe barrage employing more than 40 ballistic, cruise, anti-aircraft and guided missiles early on Tuesday hit 130 residential buildings in three Ukrainian cities, \u201call ordinary houses\u201d, Mr Zelensky said on X, formerly Twitter.\nRussia\u2019s onslaught, which included targets in the capital Kyiv and second-largest city Kharkiv, was the heaviest in weeks and lent weight to Mr Zelensky\u2019s appeals for Western allies to provide more military aid.\n\u201cThis year, the main priority is to strengthen air defense to protect our cities and towns, as well as defend frontline positions,\u201d the Ukrainian leader said on X on Tuesday night.\nWith the 930-mile front line largely static amid icy weather and as both sides seek to replenish their weapons stockpiles, the war recently has focused on long-range strikes.\nAnalysts say Russia stockpiled missiles to pursue a winter campaign of aerial bombardment, while Ukraine has sought to strike inside Russia with new types of drones.\nRussia may have employed decoy missiles in Tuesday\u2019s attack in an effort to open up holes in Ukraine\u2019s air defences, a US think tank said.\nToday is Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Service Day.

Help from the United States, by far Ukraine\u2019s single biggest provider, has also hit political snags.\nThe German defence ministry also announced on Wednesday that it plans to send six Sea King Mk41 multi-role helicopters from Bundeswehr stocks to Ukraine.\nSince the beginning of the war military deliveries from Germany have amounted to around six billion euro (\u00a35.13 billion), including substantial anti-aircraft and air defence systems, the government said.", "source_domain": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "text": null, "title": "Russian transport plane crashes with 65 Ukrainian PoWs on board", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://jerseyeveningpost.com/morenews/worldnews/2024/01/24/russian-transport-plane-crashes-with-65-ukrainian-pows-on-board/"}
