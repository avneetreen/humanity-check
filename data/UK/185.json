At the outset of the war, it also threatened to execute hostages in retaliation for Israeli military strikes. Israeli officials have generally declined to respond to Hamas\u2019s public messaging on the hostages, casting it as psychological warfare. Hagar Mizrahi, a forensic official with Israel\u2019s ministry of health, told local television on 31 December that autopsies of slain hostages who had been recovered found causes of death inconsistent with Hamas\u2019s account they had died in airstrikes. Israel has made clear it is aware of the risks to hostages from its offensive and says is taking precautions. Its operation was being adapted \u201cin accordance with the threats and the hostages who are in the field\u201d, military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said on Sunday. Of about 240 people seized by Hamas in its 7 October killing spree that sparked the war, about half were released in a November truce.

As initial briefings from the US suggested that only about a quarter of the Houthis\u2019 missile and drone attack capability had been destroyed, reports emerged of two boats trying to threaten a merchant ship in the southern Red Sea. A Houthi spokesperson said on Sunday that the group\u2019s attacks on merchant shipping travelling the busy waterway south of the Suez Canal would continue \u201cbecause they are at war with Israel.\u201d Hussain al-Bukhaiti said that if the US and UK continued to bomb Yemen, Houthi forces would attack western warships \u201cmaybe using hundreds of drones and missiles,\u201d which would represent a significant escalation. Not all the ships targeted since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October have had Israeli links. The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, told the BBC the west was \u201cprepared to back our words with actions\u201d should Houthi attacks continue, while the US and UK warships remained on high alert in the region. The leader of Hezbollah, a Houthi ally, said all ships in the southern Red Sea were now in danger. Hassan Nasrallah said the US bombing on Friday \u201cwill harm the security of all maritime navigation\u201d because \u201cthe sea has become a theatre of fighting, missiles, drones and warships.\u201d Read the full story here: Red Sea tensions simmer as all sides warn of possible further attacks Read more\nUpdated at 00.00 CET\n14 Jan 2024 23.18 CET Bangladesh has voiced its support for South Africa in its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice.
