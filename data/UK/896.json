The others freed were Doron Katz Asher, 34, and her daughters Raz Asher, four, and Aviv Asher, two; Daniele Aloni, 44, and her daughter Emilia Aloni, six.\nMedical staff can be seen walking the hostages into the centre to undergo medical examinations\nA young girl is carried to safety as part of the exchange\nLines of ambulance were seen waiting for the hostages, while the families of kidnapped hostages were seen nervously watching news broadcasts of the vans carrying their loved ones into Egypt\nA nine year old boy, his mother and grandmother are among the first 12 Israeli hostages released by Hamas thugs\nThe 13 Israeli hostages released from Hamas captivity: Margalit Moses, Adina Moshe, Danielle Aloni and her daughter Emilia, Doron Asher and her daughters Raz and Aviv, Hanna Katzir, Keren Munder and her son Ohad, Ruti Munder, Yaffa Adar, and Hannah Perry\nThe hostages being transported to freedom after their release was secured from Hamas\nHamas fighters are seen directing hostages - including Thai and Filipino nationals - to be taken to safety by the International Red Cross\nA total of 13 Israelis were released by the militant terrorist group on Friday as part of an exchange deal negotiated with Israel\nThe Israeli captives released by Hamas were made up of nine women and four children\nAlso named were Ruth Munder, 78, her daughter Keren, 54, and grandson Ohad, nine. The final four were Adina Moshe, 72, Chana Katzir, 76, Margalit Moses, 78, and Yafa Adar, 85.\nIn a cruel psychological ploy last month, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group - another terror mob based in the occupied territory affiliated with Hamas - said Mrs Katzir had died, while Mrs Moshe was seen on a motorbike being driven to Gaza.\nIn an operation codenamed Heaven's Door by the Israelis, 39 Palestinian prisoners were also freed \u2013 again mainly women and children under 18 \u2013 who had been convicted mainly of rioting in the West Bank.\nHamas also released 10 Thai nationals and one Filipino after the pause in the fighting, which erupted last month when its heavily armed terrorists launched a bloody massacre across southern Israel.\nMore than 1,200 people were killed, including an estimated 340 at the Nova music festival. Around 240 Israelis, men, women and children were taken hostage.\nAhead of the Israelis being released, defence minister Yoav Gallant vowed to carry on avenging those killed.\nHe said: 'There will be a short pause and then we will continue operating with full military power.\n'We will not stop until we achieve our goals: the destruction of Hamas and bringing home the hostages from Gaza to Israel \u2013 there are 240 hostages and it is something we cannot accept and cannot tolerate.'\nMr Gallant and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 who has faced criticism for his handing of the situation \u2013 watched the release from a bunker in Tel Aviv.\nFootage released by Hamas showed members of the terrorist group dressed in balaclavas and body armour handing the hostages to the International Red Cross.\nThe 13 who were released were kept near Khan Yunis in the south of the Gaza Strip before being taken to the border, driven into Egypt and then to an Israeli air base before being flown on helicopters to hospitals across the country.\nAmong the Palestinians freed was Asraa Jabas, 38, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison after a failed suicide bombing near Jerusalem in 2015.\nShe suffered extensive injuries in the incident and a police officer was also badly hurt. Jabas caused outrage by demanding Israel pay for her plastic surgery.\nIn an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera, her brother Suhaib said: 'We have been told by the police not to celebrate her release and not to hand out cakes. There can be no visible sign of a show of support for Hamas.'\nOne of the Palestinian prisoners, Marah Bakeer, said she had been kept in solitary confinement and had 'no idea' about the situation in Gaza.\nShe added: 'The news of the deal was a surprise. This deal comes following the death of many people and this makes us unhappy and uncomfortable.'\nFamilies with loved ones still in Gaza spoke of their emotions at news that hostages had been freed.\nNiva Wenkert, whose son Omer, 22, was kidnapped at the Nova festival while his friend Irish-Israeli Kim Damti was killed, told the Mail: 'I know my son is not on the list, I didn't expect him to be.\n'He is 22 years old, he is not a young child so he is unlikely to be freed now. But he must come home soon, he has colitis, and he needs medicine, we just don't know what condition he is in.\n'We had a phone call from the soldier who has been assigned to look after us and keep us informed and he called and said Omer was not on the list.\n'At the same time, I am joyful for the hostages that have been released and I wish them well, but all I can do is hope and pray that my son will come home soon.\n'It's very difficult and we have so many questions but very few answers, we are a strong family and that is what is keeping us together. We believe in God and that helps the situation, and we believe that God will bring Omer back to us.'\nThe family have not heard anything from Omer since he was snatched at the festival.\nAgonisingly, three hours after the attack, the family were sent a video of Omer tied up in a pick-up truck in his underwear.\nMrs Wenkert said: 'I saw that he is alive in that video and I saw his eyes, he has to come back alive.'\nThe hostages will be debriefed by intelligence officials at a military base, who will want to know as much as possible about where the others are being kept. A further batch of hostages is expected to be released this afternoon.\nThe children were given air defenders by doctors to protect their hearing before getting on board the helicopters. Upon their arrival, each hostage was assigned to a designated soldier, ensuring personalised care and support.\nAn International Red Cross vehicle carrying Israeli hostages crosses the Rafah border checkpoint linking Egypt to Gaza\nSeveral Red Cross vehicles made their way into Egypt for the handover, which saw 13 Israelis returned to home soil after being released by Hamas\nAll of the hostages were taken from Nir Oz, a kibbutz less than two miles from the Israel-Gaza border, apart from Chana Peri - who was snatched from kibbutz Nirim.\nIn a statement the IDF said: 'Special Forces and ISA Forces are currently with the released hostages.\n'The released hostages underwent an initial medical assessment inside Israeli territory.\n'They will continue to be accompanied by IDF soldiers as they make their way to Israeli hospitals, where they will be reunited with their families.\n'The Israel Defense Forces salutes and embraces the released hostages upon their return home.\n'The IDF, together with the entire Israeli security establishment, will continue operating until all the hostages are returned home.\n'The IDF Spokesperson reiterates the importance of demonstrating patience and sensitivity during this time out of respect for the released hostages and their families.'\nWriting on Facebook after the Ashers' release was confirmed Yoni Asher said: 'They're finally here, at home.\n'There will be more time to talk about everything. For now - thank you all. from the bottom of my heart, for the support and the warm hug.\n'There's no victory picture until everyone returns,' adding a heart emoji.\nPictures of the first Red Cross carrying hostages appears to show several elderly people being taken to be treated.\nOne of the elderly hostages was named as Adina Moshe, 72 (pictured)\nLive footage has so far shown three elderly women, wearing blue medical gowns, being walked into a trauma centre at the Rafah Crossing\nBabies and children can be seen being walked onto a white bus, having gone through the medical examinations\nIt is understood that those involved in the deal are under orders to treat the hostages with the utmost sensitivity\nThe families of kidnapped hostages were seen nervously watching news broadcasts of the vans carrying their loved ones into Egypt - but broke into cheers as the transfer was made\nPeople in Tel Aviv applaud as the release of Israeli captives by Hamas is announced\nPeople in Tel Aviv react to live footage as it emerges that one of the released hostages is Hanna Katzir, who had previously been reported to have died\nLive footage has so far shown three elderly women, wearing blue medical gowns, being walked into a trauma centre at the Rafah Crossing.\nMedical staff can be seen walking the hostages into the centre to undergo medical examinations.\nBabies and children can be seen being walked onto a white bus, having gone through the medical examinations.\nOne of the elderly hostages was named as Adina Moshe, 72.\nCorinne Moshe, her daughter-in-law, told the Reuters news agency her husband and his siblings were waiting at a hospital to be reunited with their mother.\nShe said: 'I miss her very, very much, I want her to be back already.
