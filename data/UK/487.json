Two women were allegedly killed by an Israeli military sniper in the church on Saturday.\n\u201cThe people in this church are civilians. They have nothing to do with Hamas. They are nuns, orphans, disabled people. They are a small community who know everyone. It is categorically untrue to say Hamas are operating from there,\u201d she told MPs after she was granted an urgent question on the situation in Gaza.\nMitchell told parliament he hoped that the UK would be able to support a UN security council resolution vote at 3pm (UK time) to call for a ceasefire. While the UK had abstained from a previous vote, whether it would support another one was dependent on the text, he added.\nThe sometimes bitter fault lines that the conflict has created within both the Conservatives and Labour were once again laid bare as Tory MPs clashed on the question of a supporting a ceasefire.\nFlick Drummond, a Conservative MP among a grouping who added pressure on the government for a shift in its approach to the conflict, said on Tuesday morning that an \u201cannihilation\u201d was taking place in Gaza. She shook her head as her colleague Andrew Percy said it was almost as if some MPs did not want Israel to succeed in wiping out Hamas.\nMitchell said he did not agree with the former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who said \u201ctalk of a sustainable ceasefire was unhelpful\u201d and that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) \u201cshould be allowed to finish the job\u201d.\n\u201cWe are working towards a sustainable ceasefire. We are not there yet. We should all be working towards it,\u201d said Mitchell, who added that the UK wanted to see a more \u201csurgical approach\u201d by Israeli forces.\nForeign policy experts including a former head of the armed forces have meanwhile urged David Cameron to back an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d in Gaza in the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s crucial UN security council vote.\nThe failure to call for a ceasefire was \u201cstrategically ill-advised and morally indefensible\u201d, the British foreign secretary was told in a letter.\nCameron will call for increased coordination between allies to address the \u201cdesperate\u201d humanitarian situation, and use a trip to Paris and Rome on Tuesday to reiterate his call for a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza. But the spotlight falls on the UN security council meeting after the US vetoed a previous attempt to pass a ceasefire motion.\n\u201cThe UK does not have to follow America\u2019s lead \u2013 particularly when US public and opinion is far from united,\u201d says the letter from Gen Lord David Richards, a former head of the armed forces, and others including six former UK ambassadors.\nThey welcomed the \u201cslight positive change in tone\u201d last week, adding: \u201cWe implore the United Kingdom to once again work with all members of the UN security council to ensure a renewed resolution for an immediate ceasefire is brought forward, and then to vote in favour of it.\u201d\nRishi Sunak told MPs on the Commons liaison committee that he did not want the Israel-Gaza conflict to last \u201ca moment longer than it has to\u201d, when asked if the UK would back a United Nations resolution on ceasefire.\nHe said it was \u201cclear that too many innocent civilians have died\u201d in Gaza, adding that UK had \u201crepeatedly\u201d urged Israel to show restraint. Pressed over whether Israel had broken international law in its pounding of Gaza, he suggested that Hamas was responsible for hiding amid the civilian population.\nThe prime minister denied that cuts to the UK\u2019s aid budget had contributed to attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "MPs clash in Commons as government urged to back instant Gaza ceasefire", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/19/foreign-policy-david-cameron-immediate-gaza-ceasefire"}
