He predicted catastrophic consequences if fuel supplies ran out, including the collapse of sewage systems and healthcare and an end to the already scarce supplies of humanitarian aid.\nIn Gaza City, IDF troops were searching the underground levels of al-Shifa hospital and detaining technicians responsible for running its equipment, the Hamas-run health ministry said.\nMunir al-Boursh, a senior official inside the hospital, said troops ransacked the basement and other buildings and questioned and face-screened patients, staff and people sheltering in the facility, the Associated Press reported.\nMeanwhile, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, which is separate from Hamas, said its fighters were involved in \u201cfierce clashes\u201d with Israeli forces near the hospital complex, the BBC reported.\nHundreds of patients, including newborn babies inside Shifa, have suffered for days without electricity and other basic necessities.\nThe hospital has become a strategic objective for Israel, which says there is a Hamas command centre in bunkers underneath, which Hamas and hospital staff deny.\nCivilians in Gaza react to warnings war could spread further south \u2013 video\nAn IDF official said on Thursday that troops were still inside the hospital complex, searching one building at a time in \u201ca discrete, methodical and thorough manner\u201d.\nThe official said the IDF had located weapons, intelligence material, military technologies and equipment, command and control centres and communications equipment belonging to Hamas. They added that information and footage about the hostages abducted from Israel were found on computers and other technological equipment. The official did not provide evidence.\nOn Wednesday, Hamas described Israel\u2019s claims that military equipment had been found as \u201cnothing but a continuation of the lies and cheap propaganda, through which [Israel] is trying to give justification for its crime aimed at destroying the health sector in Gaza\u201d.\nHamas militants stormed southern Israeli towns and kibbutzim on 7 October, killing an estimated 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostages.\nOn Thursday morning, the IDF said Israeli fighter jets had struck the house of the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Gaza. In a social media post that included a video said to show the strike, the IDF said the home \u201cwas used as terrorist infrastructure and a meeting point for Hamas\u2019s senior leaders to direct terrorist attacks against Israel\u201d.\nOn Wednesday, Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said the IDF\u2019s ground operation would eventually \u201cinclude both the north and south\u201d. \u201cWe will strike Hamas wherever it is,\u201d he said.\nTwo reporters who live east of Khan Younis confirmed seeing the leaflets, and others shared images of the leaflets on social media, Reuters reported. The military declined to comment.\nThe leaflets read: \u201cFor your safety, you need to evacuate your places of residence immediately and head to known shelters \u2026 Anyone near terrorists or their facilities puts their life at risk, and every house used by terrorists will be targeted.\u201d\nView image in fullscreen Palestinians fleeing northern Gaza for the south at the weekend. Photograph: Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/Shutterstock\nTwo-thirds of the Gaza Strip\u2019s population of 2.3 million have been made homeless by the war and every available space in Khan Younis and other southern towns is crammed.\nMohammed Ghalayini, 44, a civil servant from Manchester who is in the centre of Khan Younis, said there was a housing crisis across the city.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a massive influx of people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest place and it\u2019s the place where there\u2019s more potential to find somewhere to stay.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a massive housing crisis. Every day three people that I know call me saying \u2018can you help me find a place?\u2019 and it\u2019s really hard, because there are no places. Even if you have the space, it\u2019s whether it can support people in terms of water and sanitation.\u201d\nMore than 11,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Palestinian health authorities. Another 2,700 have been reported missing, with most believed to be buried under the rubble.\nThe Israeli army on Thursday announced the deaths of two more soldiers in Gaza, increasing the number of troops killed in the territory to 50 since the start of the war.\nOn Wednesday, three suspected Palestinian assailants opened fire at a checkpoint on a road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem, wounding six security force members before the assailants were shot dead, Israeli police said.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel drops leaflets warning people to flee southern Gaza towns", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/16/israel-drops-leaflets-warning-people-to-flee-southern-gaza-towns"}
