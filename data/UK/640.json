Notably, the man is being held at gunpoint and issued directions from off-screen, so it's unclear whether he is \"surrendering\" the weapons or just moving them as instructed. Given he is already in his underwear and he cannot have been concealing them on his person, it's unlikely Israeli troops did not know about these weapons, suggesting this may be performed for the camera, rather than as an act of authentic surrender. We also don't know if he, or any of the other individuals in the video, have any involvement with Hamas or the 7 October attack.", "source_domain": "www.bbc.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Israel-Gaza war: Video shows Gaza detainees allegedly 'surrendering guns' - what we know", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67675407?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA"}
