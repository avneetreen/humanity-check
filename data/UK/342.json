I refuse to take part in a war of revenge,\u201d Mitnick wrote in a statement.\nMilitary conscription is a unifying cornerstone in Israeli society. It is hard to completely trust the IDF figures due to a lack of transparency, but its official numbers show that 69% of men and 56% of women are conscripted for service at 18. This makes the military uniform an emblem of collective national identity, perhaps even more important than the flag, epitomised by the Israeli maxim: \u201cA nation building an army is a nation building itself.\u201d\nThe military is so ingrained in the fabric of society, the service is as much a sociological phenomenon as an ideological duty. Most soldiers aren\u2019t fighters. They have roles from cooks, to radio DJs, to teachers. The army has learned to absorb groups it dismissed in the past, like LGBTQ+ people, and even serves vegan food. You can serve in the military and still live at home, treating it as a regular day job.\nWhereas military service in the US and UK is considered \u201ca way out\u201d \u2013 from poverty or a lower social class \u2013 in Israel, it\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s a way into society, where jobs are advertised for \u201cpost-army\u201d folks, where social clout is measured by your achievements in the military, and where casual conversations invariably drift to \u201cwhere did you serve?\u201d The military serves as a gateway to a complete Israeli identity, bridging all strata of the social hierarchy.\nYet even with the ubiquity of the military, an undercurrent of dissent exists. Like Mitnick, I also refused IDF enlistment. Examples of refusals are rare but have happened throughout Israel\u2019s history. There are the 3,000 reserve soldiers who protested against the first Lebanon war in 1983, of whom 160 were jailed for their refusal to serve. And also figures like Knesset member Ofer Cassif, who objected to serving in the West Bank, as well as pilots rejecting missions they considered illegal, and a handful of teenagers annually facing jail for opposing service in the occupied territories, with groups like Mesarvot supporting their journey.\nUnlike a majority of conscientious objectors who make up a slender slice of Israel\u2019s populace and often hail from its upper tiers, I came from a small village at Israel\u2019s periphery and went to school on a kibbutz where the ethos of service and sacrifice was strongly felt. Expressing hesitation about the militaristic culture and already deemed problematic by my school, I was tagged during my army processing to be sent to an assessment board.\n00:01:09 Young child pulled out of rubble alive after airstrike hits Rafah in Gaza \u2013 video\nOpting out of service isn\u2019t straightforward. Refusal is rare partly because the army leaves little room for dissent. The Israeli high court of justice has ruled that while absolute pacifism is a valid reason for exemption, \u201cselective refusal\u201d \u2013 rejecting specific duties \u2013 is illegal. This stance, especially the refusal to serve in the occupied territories, is seen as a threat to national unity. Those few exempted on grounds of pacifism are also restricted from discussing the occupation or Israel\u2019s politics more widely.\nThe IDF\u2019s handling of refusers is also not consistent. Some face trials and multiple imprisonments before being discharged by a military psychiatric board. Others, like myself, are sent directly to this board. There, I had to articulate my beliefs to a tribunal of officers, which at 17 were more intuitive than clearly defined. The main method the army uses to release refusers is by declaring them mentally unfit for service, implying that in Israel dissent is equated with insanity.\nThe experience of getting out is disorienting, like stepping into an alternative reality. In my case, in the post-school wilderness and unskilled, I ended up in construction, a field shared by Palestinians, migrant workers and marginalised groups. Choices are slim for those who made the ethical choice to refuse enlistment, with plenty of personal and social ramifications.\nOur refusal to serve wasn\u2019t a gesture for external validation, or even to seek acknowledgment from Palestinians who were segregated from us by language and fences; but about taking a stand against the moral decay within \u2013 showing others and ourselves there is another path.\nBut refusers aren\u2019t heroes. No one who has refused thinks they are. I know I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t find valour in my decision \u2013 but alienation. The choice to reject something central to my society meant I could never be fully part of it. There are even moments of self-doubt and guilt \u2013 have I neglected my duty? This is felt especially keenly when friends confront conflict and loss, however removed we are from their cause.\nRefusal isn\u2019t heroic but it expresses a different kind of resolution \u2013 the resolution to stand alone, to navigate the complexities of dissent, and to remain true to your beliefs in the face of societal dissonance; to realise that rebellion is required when facing a violent and unsustainable status quo.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Like Tal Mitnick, I refused to serve Israel as a soldier.
