NATO as an organization is not directly involved in the conflict, except to supply Kyiv with non-lethal support, although many member countries send weapons and ammunition individually or in groups, and provide military training.\nIn the months before President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine in February 2022, NATO began beefing up security on its eastern flank with Russia and Ukraine. It\u2019s the alliance\u2019s biggest buildup since the Cold War. The wargames are meant to deter Russia from targeting a member country.\nThe exercises \u2013 dubbed Steadfast Defender 24 \u2013 \u201cwill show that NATO can conduct and sustain complex multi-domain operations over several months, across thousands of kilometers (miles), from the High North to Central and Eastern Europe, and in any condition,\u201d the 31-nation organization said.\nTroops will be moving to and through Europe until the end of May in what NATO describes as \u201ca simulated emerging conflict scenario with a near-peer adversary.\u201d Under NATO\u2019s new defense plans, its chief adversaries are Russia and terrorist organizations.\n\u201cThe alliance will demonstrate its ability to reinforce the Euro-Atlantic area via transatlantic movement of forces from North America,\u201d NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander, U.S. General Christopher Cavoli, told reporters.\nCavoli said it will demonstrate \"our unity, our strength, and our determination to protect each other.\u201d\nThe chair of the NATO Military Committee, Admiral Rob Bauer, said that it\u2019s \u201ca record number of troops that we can bring to bear and have an exercise within that size, across the alliance, across the ocean from the U.S. to Europe.\u201d\nBauer described it as \u201ca big change\u201d compared to troop numbers exercising just a year ago. Sweden, which is expected to join NATO this year, will also take part.\nU.K. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps has said that the government in London would send 20,000 troops backed by advanced fighter jets, surveillance planes, warships and submarines, with many being deployed in eastern Europe from February to June.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "NATO to start biggest wargames in decades next week, involving around 90,000 personnel", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/nato-ap-russia-brussels-eastern-europe-b2480997.html"}
