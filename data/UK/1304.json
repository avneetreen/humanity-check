Thank you for reading. Here\u2019s a rundown on where things stand as it just passes 8am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 30 people were killed in an Israeli bombing of the Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza late on Saturday. Hamas said in a statement on Telegram that Israel had \u201cdirectly\u201d bombed citizens\u2019 homes, adding that most of the dead were women and children. The Palestinian news agency Wafa earlier put the death toll at 51, with scores wounded.\nUS president Joe Biden signalled there were small signs of progress being made towards a humanitarian pause in the war between Israel and Hamas on Saturday. US officials have been pushing for a pause but so far with little impact.\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society received 30 aid trucks that entered Gaza through the Rafah border crossing on Saturday. Three were handed to the Red Cross and 19 to UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.

Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam brigades, also said on Hamas\u2019s Telegram account that 23 bodies of Israeli hostages were trapped under the rubble. Reuters could not immediately verify the statement.\nProtesters gathered outside the residence of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid growing anger at the government\u2019s failures that led to Hamas\u2019s deadly attacks against Israel on 7 October. Protesters also gathered in Tel Aviv, with many holding signs that said \u201cCeasefire\u201d and others that read \u201cRelease the hostages now at all costs\u201d.\nAgence France-Presse has called on Israel ot provide \u201can in-depth and transparent investigation\u201d into the exact involvement of its army after a strike severely damaged its office in Gaza City , which has been shelled for weeks. \u201cA strike on the offices of an international news agency sends a deeply troubling message to all the journalists working in such difficult conditions in Gaza,\u201d the news agency\u2019s chairman and CEO Fabrice Fries said.\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken has reaffirmed US support for \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d in the ongoing fight between Israel and Hamas. In an address in Amman, Jordan, about sparing civilians and speeding up aid deliveries entering into Gaza, Blinken said: \u201cThe United States believes that all of these efforts will be facilitated by humanitarian pauses.\u201d\nFour police officers were injured and 29 people were arrested after thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square demanding a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.

On Saturday, several Middle East foreign ministers urged the US to persuade Israel to agree to a ceasefire in a meeting with the secretary of state, Antony Blinken. The top US diplomat, however, dismissed the idea, saying such a halt would only benefit Hamas, allowing the militant organisation to regroup and attack again. The diplomatic wrangling came as the conflict entered its fifth week, with reports that more than 30 people were killed in a strike on a refugee camp in central Gaza.

The Jerusalem Post had tweeted earlier that \u201crocket sirens sounded in Misgav Am, near the Lebanese-Israeli border, on Sunday morning\u201d. The sirens came amid ongoing skirmishes between Israeli troops and Hezbollah militants across the frontier.\n5 Nov 2023 05.18 CET Thousands of people filled the streets of downtown Washington DC on Saturday afternoon to protest against the Biden administration\u2019s support of Israel and its continued military campaign in Gaza, Associated Press reports. \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\u201d chanted demonstrators, who were mainly young people. There is controversy around the slogan\u2019s meaning, with some saying it advocates the destruction of Israel. The demonstrators wore black and white keffiyehs as an enormous Palestinian flag was unfurled by a crowd that filled Pennsylvania Avenue, the street leading up to the White House. Dozens of small white body bags with the names of children killed lined the street and demonstrators held signs calling for an immediate ceasefire.

In Jenin, one Palestinian was injured, while at least one other was arrested during a raid.\nUpdated at 05.29 CET\n5 Nov 2023 04.51 CET Harriet Sherwood The \u201cday after\u201d the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza may still be weeks or months away, but it will come. \u201cWhen this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next,\u201d US president Joe Biden said recently. \u201cAnd in our view, it has to be a two-state solution.\u201d Against a backdrop of repeated cycles of violence and a military occupation lasting more than half a century, diplomats and analysts agree that lasting peace must follow the bloodiest fighting between Israelis and Palestinians for decades. The two-state solution to the bitter conflict that has beset the region for almost a century \u2013 dividing the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean to carve out two independent, sovereign Israeli and Palestinian states existing side by side \u2013 has repeatedly been endorsed by world leaders. But it has proved impossible for Israel and the Palestinians to reach an agreement. And, since US-brokered talks collapsed in 2014, and as Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have proliferated, the consensus has been that the two-state solution is dead. Can it be revived? And \u2013 given the continuing war, regional tensions and settlers\u2019 presence in what would be a Palestinian state \u2013 what might a two-state solution look like?

In its statement on a conversation between the two leaders on Saturday, Trudeau\u2019s office said he \u201chighlighted his deep concerns with the dire humanitarian crisis, and reiterated Canada\u2019s position on the immediate need to create conditions for urgent and necessary humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza\u201d. Trudeau\u2019s office said the leaders agreed on the need for all hostages held in Gaza to be immediately released, adding: The two leaders also discussed ongoing efforts to get foreign citizens out of Gaza and the prime minister thanked prime minister Netanyahu for Israel\u2019s assurances that Canadians in Gaza will be able to leave in the coming days. Trudeau\u2019s office also said the two leaders \u201cdenounced Hamas\u2019 continued terror and discussed the risk of potential escalation in the region\u201d and that Trudeau \u201cunderscored Canada\u2019s enduring support for a two-state solution and for the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace, dignity and security\u201d. Trudeau also \u201crecognised the disturbing rise of antisemitism around the world, including in Canada, and the impact of the October 7 attack on Canada\u2019s Jewish community\u201d.\n5 Nov 2023 03.59 CET Just to recap: President Joe Biden suggested there have been some advances in US attempts to persuade Israel to pause military strikes on Gaza for humanitarian reasons. In a brief exchange with reporters as he left a church in Delaware on Saturday, Biden was asked if there was progress and he responded \u201cYes\u201d and gave a thumbs-up, but did not share specifics. Associated Press also reported that the comment came after US secretary of state Antony Blinken met with his Arab counterparts on Saturday. He disagreed with them on the need for an immediate ceasefire, saying that would leave Hamas in place, and made clear the furthest he would go was backing a pause for aid to reach civilians in Gaza.\nUpdated at 04.03 CET\n5 Nov 2023 03.26 CET The Israel Defence Forces has posted a video on social media of apparent Hamas tunnels in northern Gaza, saying Israel troops had uncovered \u201cmultiple access points\u201d to them.

A similar banner displayed at a protest in Warsaw was condemned by the Israeli ambassador to Poland as \u201cblatant antisemitism\u201d. Effigies of dead babies were left on the ground in Trafalgar Square, next to pictures of children and candles. The Metropolitan police issued a dispersal order for an area around the square which will remain in force until 1am. An order was also issued giving officers the power to require someone to remove any item being used to conceal their identity, the force said.\n5 Nov 2023 02.53 CET Gaza ministry says more than 30 killed in Israeli bombing of Maghazi refugee camp The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 30 people were killed in an Israeli bombing of the Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza late on Saturday, Agence France-Presse reports. \u201cMore than 30 [dead] arrived at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al-Balah in the massacre committed by the occupation in al-Maghazi camp in the central Gaza Strip,\u201d a health ministry spokesperson, Ashraf Al-Qudra, said in a statement.
