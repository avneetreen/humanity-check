Gaza health authorities said more than 9,770 Palestinians have been killed in the retaliatory Israeli strikes. This includes over 4,000 children.\nIsrael claimed it is aiming its attacks at Hamas, not civilians, and accuses the group of using them as human shields. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said 31 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the ground operation began in Gaza on 27 October.\nDifficult negotiations have continued to secure the release of the captives that include some Americans, Mr Finer said.\n\u201cThose negotiations are going on quietly behind the scenes. They have taken longer than any of us would like,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we continue to believe that there is the possibility of getting a significant number of these hostages released.\u201d\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday spoke about the need for a pause in hostilities to allow hostages to get out, and the White House said it supports a \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d to allow aid deliveries to Gaza.\nA spokesperson for IDF told CNN late on Sunday that bombardments in northern Gaza were halted for several hours for two days in a row to allow civilians safe passage to move to the south of the narrow coastal strip.\nLieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus, the spokesperson, said there was access to water and humanitarian goods in the south of Gaza, but claimed Hamas was impeding convoys by firing on them. These claims could not be independently verified.\nMeanwhile, Mr Blinken met Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas on Sunday. Aside from pleasantries, neither man spoke as they greeted each other in front of cameras and the meeting ended without any public comment. It was not immediately clear if the lack of words indicated the meeting had gone poorly.\nUS CIA director William Burns is set to visit Israel on Monday to discuss the war and intelligence with senior officials, reported The New York Times.
