A statement from Hagari on Thursday said IDF troops \u201ccompleted the encirclement of Gaza City, which is the focal point of the Hamas terror organisation\u201d. Israeli forces are \u201ckilling terrorists in close combat, in any place in which fighting is required\u201d, he said.\nUpdated at 22.06 CET\n3 Nov 2023 05.35 CET Troops \u2018completed the encirclement of Gaza City\u2019, says IDF Here is another look at the IDF\u2019s announcement that it has \u201ccompleted the encirclement of Gaza City\u201d via AFP: Israeli ground troops encircled Hamas stronghold Gaza City on Friday, after close ally the United States urged \u201cconcrete steps\u201d to minimise civilian casualties. Ahead of top US diplomat Antony Blinken\u2019s scheduled visit to Israel Friday, the country\u2019s military said it had \u201ccompleted the encirclement\u201d of Gaza\u2019s largest city \u2013 signalling a new phase in the month-long war against Hamas. Israel\u2019s military describes Gaza City as \u201cthe centre of the Hamas terror organisation\u201d. But it is also home to some half a million Palestinians who have endured weeks of withering aerial bombardments, dwindling supplies and daily bloodshed on an unprecedented scale. Outside Gaza City\u2019s Al-Quds hospital, displaced residents seeking shelter from Israeli strikes told AFP that civilians would not withstand the barrage much longer. \u201cThis is not a life. We need a safe place for our kids,\u201d said 50-year-old Hiyam Shamlakh.\n\u201cEverybody is terrified, children, women and the elderly.\u201d The conflict is turning to urban and underground warfare, with Hamas fighting from a tunnel complex believed to span hundreds of kilometres. A new video posted by Hamas sought to illustrate the devastating impact of its underground network, with a gunman seemingly emerging from a tunnel to plant an explosive on a nearby and unsuspecting Israeli tank. The Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, insisted invading Israeli soldiers would go home \u201cin black bags\u201d. \u201cGaza will be the curse of history for Israel,\u201d spokesman Abu Obeida said.\n3 Nov 2023 05.22 CET Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told group of elite soldiers on Thursday that Israeli forces were \u201cadvancing\u201d despite \u201cpainful losses\u201d, AFP reports. \u201cWe are in the midst of the campaign. We have very impressive successes\u201d he said at a base near Tel Aviv. \u201cWe are already more than on the outskirts of Gaza City. We are advancing.\u201d\n3 Nov 2023 05.05 CET Johana Bhuiyan A WhatsApp feature that generates images in response to users\u2019 searches returns a picture of a gun or a boy with a gun when prompted with the terms \u201cPalestinian\u201d, \u201cPalestine\u201d or \u201cMuslim boy Palestinian\u201d, the Guardian has learned. The search results varied when tested by different users, but the Guardian verified through screenshots and its own tests that various stickers portraying guns surfaced for these three search results. Prompts for \u201cIsraeli boy\u201d generated cartoons of children playing soccer and reading. In response to a prompt for \u201cIsrael army\u201d the AI created drawings of soldiers smiling and praying, no guns involved.

At a campaign event on Wednesday Biden was urged by a member of the audience to call for a ceasefire in the war. Biden replied: \u201cI think we need a pause.\u201d Talking to reporters Thursday National Security Council spokesman John Kirby clarified what such a pause would entail. \u201cA humanitarian pause... is temporary, localized and focused, focused on a particular objective or objectives, humanitarian aid in, people out,\u201d Kirby said. He added: \u201cThe general idea is that in that geographic space, for that limited time, there would be a cessation of hostilities, enough to allow whatever it is you\u2019re trying to allow.\u201d The White House has previously called for \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d to allow aid to be delivered into Gaza or to carry out evacuations, but has so far refused to discuss a ceasefire, believing it would exclusively play into the hands of Hamas.\n3 Nov 2023 04.37 CET Hezbollah on Wednesday published a letter from its fighters addressed to Palestinian groups in Gaza, saying they had their \u201cfinger with you on the trigger... to support Al-Aqsa mosque and our oppressed brothers in Palestine\u201d, AFP reports. The Shiite Muslim group has mainly restricted itself to targeting Israeli observation posts, military positions and vehicles near the border as well as drones, using what it says have been anti-tank missiles, guided missiles and even surface-to-air missiles. Israel has responded by bombing sites along the border, while drones have targeted fighters near the frontier. The border tensions have revived memories of Hezbollah\u2019s devastating 2006 war with Israel that killed more than 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 160 in Israel, largely soldiers.\n3 Nov 2023 04.26 CET More now on what analysts expect ahead of Nasrallah\u2019s speech, via AFP: Some analysts believe that Hezbollah has little interest in becoming fully embroiled in a conflict that Israeli officials have threatened could destroy Lebanon. Others say the decision lies with Iran, which leads the regional \u201caxis of resistance\u201d against Israel, which alongside Hezbollah includes armed groups from Syria, Iraq and Yemen, some of which have attacked Israel and US interests in the region in recent weeks.

Hezbollah doesn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to intervene.\u201d \u201cHezbollah has much more experience obviously fighting Israel than Iran does - Iran has not had a direct confrontation with Israel,\u201d Saad added.\n3 Nov 2023 04.09 CET Hezbollah leader to speak on Friday AFP reports that Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, will speak on Friday, in his first comments since 7 October. Lebanon\u2019s southern border has seen escalating tit-for-tat exchanges in recent weeks, mainly between Israel and Iran-funded Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, stoking fears of a broader conflagration. The cross-border attacks heated up on Thursday, as Israel responded with a \u201cbroad assault\u201d after Hezbollah attacked 19 Israeli positions simultaneously, according to the group.

Photograph: Aziz Taher/Reuters Rockets also hit the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona near the border in a barrage claimed by the Lebanese section of Hamas\u2019s armed wing. Nasrallah\u2019s highly anticipated speech will be broadcast as part of an event in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold, at 3pm (13.00 GMT) on Friday, in memory of fighters killed in Israeli bombardments. Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has warned that \u201cthe region is like a powder keg\u201d and that \u201canything is possible\u201d if Israel does not stop attacking Gaza. US national security council spokesman John Kirby told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve seen any indication yet specifically that Hezbollah is ready to go in full force. So we\u2019ll see what he has to say.\u201d\nUpdated at 04.10 CET\n3 Nov 2023 04.00 CET Reuters reports that Chilean President Gabriel Boric, who this week condemned Israeli military\u2019s air bombardment of Gaza and recalled his envoy to Israel, on Thursday said he told President Joe Biden that Israel\u2019s actions were violating international law. Boric said he condemned the 7 October attack on Israel by the Hamas militant group that killed 1,400 people, and called for the release of Israeli hostages, but added Israel\u2019s retaliatory bombardment of Gaza had been disproportionate and was violating international law. \u201cThese Hamas attacks are without justification, they deserve global condemnation, but the response by Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government also deserves our clearest condemnation,\u201d he told reporters after his meeting with Biden at the White House. There\u2019s no doubt we can say the response has been disproportionate and is violating international humanitarian law,\u201d he said. \u201cThe right of a state to defend itself has limits, and those limits imply respecting the lives of innocent civilians, especially children, and respecting civil humanitarian law.\u201d Asked about Biden\u2019s response, Boric said it was not his place to speak for the American president. The White House issued a statement later on Thursday that said Biden had \u201creaffirmed our continued efforts to urgently increase and sustain the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance * including food, water, and medical care * to civilians in Gaza.\u201d View image in fullscreen US President Joe Biden meets with Chile's President Gabriel Boric in the Oval Office Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n3 Nov 2023 03.40 CET Four Indonesians evacuated from Gaza Indonesia\u2019s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said on Friday that four Indonesians and one wife of an Indonesian national had been evacuated from Gaza on 2 November.\nThe evacuees had arrived in Cairo, she said in a press conference.\n3 Nov 2023 03.35 CET Here is another profile of one of the 3,760 children killed by Israeli strikes on Gaza, from the Associated Press: Aseel Hassan, 13 years old\nAseel Hassan was an excellent student, said her father, Hazem Bin Saeed. She devoured classical Arabic poetry, memorizing its rigid metric and rhyme scheme, and reveling in its mystical images and metaphors.\nDuring the war, when Israeli bombardments came so close that their walls shook, she would regale her relatives by reciting famous verses from Abu Al Tayyib al-Mutanabbi, a 10th-century Iraqi poet, her father said. \u2018When I asked her what she wanted to do when she grew up, she would say, read,\u2019 said 42-year-old Bin Saeed. \u2018Poems were Aseel\u2019s escape.\u2019 An airstrike on 19 October leveled his three-story home in Deir al-Balah, killing Aseel and her 14-year-old brother, Anas.\nUpdated at 03.36 CET", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "WHO says \u2018almost impossible\u2019 to bring aid into Gaza - as it happened", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/02/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-gaza-jabalia-refugee-camp-strikes-today-latest-news"}
