He really wanted to be famous,' the military said.\nNestor 'El Nini' P\u00e9rez, who was the alleged security chief for El Chapo's sons, was celebrating the release of his own narco corrido (ballad) that was interpreted by Mexican norte\u00f1o band Los Tucanes de Tijuana when he was arrested November 22, the same day the song premiered\nMario Quintero, lead singer of Mexican band Los Tucanes de Tijuana, narrated the narco life of Nestor 'El Nini' P\u00e9rez, the alleged security chief for El Chapo's son, in a song titled 'Comandante 09,' which was released November 22, the same day El Nini was arrested in Culiac\u00e1n, Mexico\nA Mexican military briefing obtained by online news outlet La Opini\u00f3n indicated that El Nini played a role in his own capture by relaxing his security protocol while he celebrated the premier of 'Comandante 09,' his nom-de-guerre within the Sinaloa Cartel.\nThe song, which was also made available on iTunes and Spotify, details El Nini's growth as a gangster member of the Arrelano-F\u00e9lix Cartel before he joined the Sinaloa Cartel.\n'He got hooked and took his gun / when he was barely 18 years old / this is how Nini's story begins with El Chapo's children,' Los Tucanes de Tijuana lead singer Mario Quintero says.\nLater in the song, Quintero mentions that El Nini was the armed protector of Los Chapitos \u2013 as Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n's four sons are known.\n'Armed wing of the heirs / in action, he is always ahead / wherever he wants he has gunmen / protecting the cartel turfs, he is very brave / he does not know fear,' the song goes. 'The commander was born very warlike / and although the government is looking for him / 09 celebrates in a big way.'\nThe song also boasts about El Nini's standing in the organization as the protector of the sons of Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n, including Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, who was briefly detained by Mexican security forces in October 2019 before President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador ordered his release after the cartel responded with a war-like assault in broad daylight.\nLos Tucanes de Tijuana were founded in 1987 and are one of the most popular bands in Mexico\nNestor 'El Nini' P\u00e9rez, 30, was apprehended at his home in Culiac\u00e1n, Mexico on November 22.

He is accused of conspiring to traffic cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl.\nHis infatuation with having his narco life narrated by Los Tucanes de Tijuana made it possible.\nIn a Thanksgiving Day statement, President Joe Biden lauded the apprehension.\n'These arrests are testament to the commitment between the United States and Mexico to secure our communities against violence, counter the cartels, and end the scourge of illicit fentanyl that is hurting so many families,' Biden said.\nU.S. federal prosecutors allege that El Nini oversaw a group known as 'Los Ninis' that served as the security team for Iv\u00e1n Guzm\u00e1n and his brothers, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n, Jes\u00fas Guzm\u00e1n and Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, who is currently in U.S. custody.\nEl Nini was allegedly involved in the 2017 torture of a Mexican federal agent. His gang reportedly received 'military-style training in multiple areas of combat, including urban warfare, special weapons and tactics, and sniper proficiency.'\nThe group also had the green light to 'kidnap, torture, and kill anyone who opposed the Chapitos,' the indictment said.\nIn 2022, P\u00e9rez and Jos\u00e9 Figueroa, who also led Los Ninis, allegedly tested the purity of a fentanyl sample on a woman and injected her 'repeatedly \u2026 until she died.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Top Mexican band Los Tucanes releases 'narco ballad' about man accused of overseeing security for cartel cell operated by El Chapo's sons - on the same day he is arrested", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12815623/Mexico-narco-corrido-Tucanes-Tijuana-El-Nini.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"}
