The group allegedly has support from neighboring Rwanda, though the country denies ties.\nMushaki is a pivotal transport hub that paves the way to larger cities in east Congo\u2019s Kivu region. It has traded hands between rebels and the army throughout the conflict and as recently as February.\nThe latest round of fighting comes as the 100 million-person nation prepares for an election later this month and President Felix Tshisekedi asks voters for another term. The election won't be held in areas wracked by violence and displacement \u2014 one of many issues observers questioning the country's ability to hold fair and free elections have raised.\nM23, largely comprised of Congolese ethnic Tutsis, was dormant for nearly a decade before resurfacing in 2021. It has since often clashed with government forces and United Nations peacekeepers, who are slated to gradually withdraw from Congo at the government\u2019s request.\nOlivier Mungwiko, a spokesperson for a civil society group focused on youth engagement in the nearby city of Sake, said soldiers and the volunteer-led self-defense groups who fight alongside them clashed until 10 a.m.\nResidents heard bombs falling from planes in nearby villages, Mungwiko said.\nLt. Col. Njike Kaiko Guillaume confirmed that the army had used its air forces to attack rebels before they were able to infiltrate Mushaki.\n\u201cWe are in the process of containing them in the hills,\u201d he said. \u201cStrategies being put in place are designed to prevent collateral damage to our population.\u201d\nM23\u2019s offensive comes during ongoing fighting that has caused further displacement since a cease-fire broke down in November 2022. Peace efforts appear to have stalled. The new round of fighting also comes amid questions about the region\u2019s long-term stability as Congolese leaders in Kinshasa push regional and international peacekeeping forces to withdraw. A regional force of officers from East African countries began leaving Goma \u2014 the capital of North Kivu \u2014 on Sunday.\nAs fighting has intensified this week, the head of the United Nations\u2019 peacekeeping mission amplified concerns and pledged to stand by the army. Bintou Keita said peacekeepers will do the \u201cutmost to ensure the protection of civilians.\u201d\n___ Associated Press writer Sam Metz contributed from Rabat, Morocco.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Rebels in Congo take key outpost in the east as peacekeepers withdraw and fighting intensifies", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-congo-rwanda-felix-tshisekedi-north-kivu-b2460460.html"}
