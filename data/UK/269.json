Rescue operations are continuing. Closer to morning we will have a better understanding of the final numbers of those who were injured,\u201d he said late on Saturday.\nRescue efforts extended into the night with emergency workers sifting through piles of rubble in the dark.\nThe Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk lies about 40km from the eastern front line.\nUkraine's military raises threat of Russian missile strikes\nIn a separate statement on Sunday, Ukraine\u2019s air force said Russia launched 28 attack drones and three cruise missile at Ukraine overnight.\nThe air force said its air defence systems destroyed 21 of the drones, but it did not say what happened to the three cruise missiles.\nThe air force said on its Telegram messaging channel that Russia targeted mainly south and east of Ukraine. \u201cThe enemy is shifting the focus of attack to the frontline territories - Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions were attacked by drones,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told national television.\nRussia said in a statement on Saturday that its troops struck a command post used by a Ukrainian military near Pokrovsk, referring to the town by its Soviet-era name Krasnoarmeisk.\nRussian military troops are repurposing missile systems, originally designed for air defense, to attack targets in the town and nearby villages.\nThese repurposed air defense missiles have poorer accuracy and may hit random targets, Ukrainian officials said.\nEarlier, Russian forces hit the Pivnichne, also in Donetsk Oblast, with two aerial bombs that killed one and injured another civilian, Mr Filashkin said in a separate post on Telegram.\nRussian troops are \u201ctrying to inflict as much grief as possible on our land,\u201d the governor said.\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly video address that the Pokrovsk attack \u201cquite simply targeted ordinary, private homes.\u201d\n\u201cRussia must be made to feel that none of these strikes will pass without consequences for the terrorist state,\u201d Mr Zelensky said.\nUN\u2019s humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine Denise Brown said she was \u201ctruly horrified\u201d by the strikes, especially by the deaths of children.\n\u201cThese were just children who have been killed because of this war,\u201d Ms Brown said.\nShe noted that the recent Russian shelling of Ukrainian towns was \u201cleaving behind an outrageous number of children. Women and men killed and injured and a trail of loss and destruction.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "At least 11 dead as Russia shifts focus of drone and missile attacks to frontline cities", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-missile-strike-drones-dnipro-kherson-b2474454.html"}
