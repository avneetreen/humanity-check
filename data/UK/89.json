It can carry up to 225 troops, according to Russia\u2019s military export agency.\nThe Russian air force has suffered a string of crashes that some observers have attributed to a higher number of flights amid the fighting in Ukraine.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a major Russian missile attack that was apparently devised to overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s air defences had killed 18 people and injured 130.\nUkraine is marking the 700th day since the full-scale invasion by Kremlin\u2019s forces started.\nThe barrage employing more than 40 ballistic, cruise, anti-aircraft and guided missiles early on Tuesday hit 130 residential buildings in three Ukrainian cities, \u201call ordinary houses\u201d, Mr Zelensky said on X, formerly Twitter.\nRussia\u2019s onslaught, which included targets in the capital Kyiv and second-largest city Kharkiv, was the heaviest in weeks and lent weight to Mr Zelensky\u2019s appeals for Western allies to provide more military aid.\n\u201cThis year, the main priority is to strengthen air defense to protect our cities and towns, as well as defend frontline positions,\u201d the Ukrainian leader said on X on Tuesday night.\nWith the 930-mile front line largely static amid icy weather and as both sides seek to replenish their weapons stockpiles, the war recently has focused on long-range strikes.\nAnalysts say Russia stockpiled missiles to pursue a winter campaign of aerial bombardment, while Ukraine has sought to strike inside Russia with new types of drones.\nRussia may have employed decoy missiles in Tuesday\u2019s attack in an effort to open up holes in Ukraine\u2019s air defences, a US think tank said.\nThe Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said Moscow is likely trying to acquire more ballistic missiles from foreign countries, including Iran and North Korea, because they may be more effective in some circumstances.\nA further barrage of Russian S-300 missiles struck residential districts of Kharkiv late on Tuesday, injuring nine people and damaging residential buildings, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said.\nRussia denies its forces strike civilian areas, although there is substantial evidence to the contrary.\nThe Russian defence ministry said that air defences shot down four Ukrainian drones over the Oryol region of western Russia early on Wednesday.\nUkraine\u2019s allies have promised to keep sending military aid packages, even though their resources are stretched. Help from the United States, by far Ukraine\u2019s single biggest provider, has also hit political snags.\nThe German defence ministry also announced on Wednesday that it plans to send six Sea King Mk41 multi-role helicopters from Bundeswehr stocks to Ukraine.\nSince the beginning of the war military deliveries from Germany have amounted to around six billion euro (\u00a35.13 billion), including substantial anti-aircraft and air defence systems, the government said.", "source_domain": "guernseypress.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018All on board killed\u2019 as Russian plane carrying Ukraine PoWs crashes", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://guernseypress.com/news/world-news/2024/01/24/all-on-board-killed-as-russian-plane-carrying-ukraine-pows-crashes/"}
