In its application, South Africa said: The acts and omissions by Israel complained of by South Africa are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group.

The prison service in a statement said the man from Nablus in the occupied West Bank had died in Meggido prison, in Israel\u2019s north, AFP reports. He was arrested in June 2022 and later sentenced to jail time for \u201csecurity offences\u201d, the statement said without naming the prisoner. \u201cAs in all such incidents, the circumstances (of his death) will be examined,\u201d it said. The Palestinian Authority\u2019s detainees commission confirmed a prisoner had died but was unable to verify further information. The prison service said the inmate was affiliated with Fatah, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas\u2019s movement. Last month Israeli police said they had questioned 19 prison guards as part of an investigation into the death of another Palestinian inmate following allegations of torture. According to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa, 38-year-old Thaer Abu Assab, from Qalqilya in the West Bank, died in November after being beaten by Israeli prison guards. Israel has intensified its arrest of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank since the 7 October Hamas attack, and there are now more than 8,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails, an historic high, the Guardian\u2019s Jason Burke and Sufian Taha reported last month. Pictures have also been leaked of Israeli troops overseeing dozens of Palestinian men detained in Gaza, stripped to their underwear and in some cases blindfolded and handcuffed. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz has reported that hundreds of the men were held at a military base in the south of Israel, and that several had died in unclear circumstances.\n1 Jan 2024 00.49 CET The US aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, deployed to the eastern Mediterranean after the deadly attack on Israel by Hamas in October, will return to the United States \u201cin the coming days,\u201d the Navy said Monday. Sent to \u201ccontribute to our regional deterrence and defense posture,\u201d the carrier will \u201credeploy to its home port as scheduled to prepare for future deployments,\u201d the Navy said in a statement according to AFP. After Hamas\u2019 bloody attack on Israel on 7 October, Washington provided military support to Israel and reinforced its forces in the region, including the USS Gerald R. Ford and other warships, in order to deter countries like Iran from escalating the conflict. \u201cThe Department of Defense continually evaluates force posture globally and will retain extensive capability both in the Mediterranean and across the Middle East,\u201d the statement added. The Navy said it was \u201ccollaborating with Allies and partners to bolster maritime security in the region.\u201d It noted that the Defense Department would continue to rely on the presence of its forces in the region \u2013 including the USS Dwight D Eisenhower carrier strike group \u2013 \u201cto deter any state or non-state actor from escalating this crisis beyond Gaza.\u201d View image in fullscreen US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, second right, talks with the commanding officer of the USS Gerald R.

Associated Press reports: According to an indictment filed on Sunday, Roi Yifrach, 35, took advantage of the chaotic situation in the aftermath of Hamas\u2019 7 October attack to join combat operations and steal large amounts of military gear, including weapons, munitions, and sensitive communications equipment. Israeli media said he spent time fighting in Gaza and even appeared in a photo next to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu during one of his visits to soldiers in the field. Yifrach went to southern Israel on 7 October and presented himself alternately as a combat soldier from elite anti-terrorism units, a bomb dispersal expert, and a member of the Shin Bet internal security service, the indictment said. Police arrested Yifrach on 17 December and found large amounts of weapons, grenades, magazines, walkie-talkies, a drone, uniforms, and other military equipment in his possession. Eitan Sabag, Yifrach\u2019s lawyer, told Israel\u2019s Channel 12 TV that Yifrach went down to the south to help as a paramedic with a first responder organisation, and fought bravely to defend Israel for more than two months. \u201cHe was helping people and helping rescue people, all under fire, while also fighting against terrorists,\u201d Sabag said. Police also detained four other people, including a police officer, in connection with the weapons theft.\n1 Jan 2024 00.21 CET Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah group has said on its Telegram account that three of its fighters have been killed in southern Lebanon. The statement gave no detail about how the three were killed, Agence France-Presse reports, but said they \u201cwere martyred on the road to (liberate) Jerusalem\u201d. Security sources said they were killed in an Israeli raid on two houses in the Lebanese village of Kafr Kila near the border where Hezbollah maintains security control. Hezbollah, an ally of Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, has been exchanging near-daily fire with Israel across Lebanon\u2019s southern frontier since the eruption of the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza in early October. The Israeli military said on Monday it struck a series of targets in Lebanon, including \u201cmilitary sites\u201d where Hezbollah was operating. Israeli air strikes and shelling have killed more than 100 Hezbollah fighters and nearly two dozen civilians, including children, elderly and several journalists, according to Hezbollah and security sources. Monday\u2019s raid comes after a senior Israeli official told Reuters that the country was expanding preparations for a Lebanon war. \u201cThe situation on the Lebanese front will not be allowed to continue.

The before-and-after images depict both cities as of 3 August this year and 31 December. \u201cGaza City is now a different colour from space.

The Guardian\u2019s Emine Sinmaz reports: When Maya Puder went missing from the Supernova music festival in Israel on 7 October, her family prayed she was in hiding somewhere or had been kidnapped. The 25-year-old aspiring actor and film-maker last messaged her parents at 8.01am to say she was sheltering from Hamas rockets. But her family\u2019s hopes were shattered four days later when they were told Maya had been found dead 20 metres away from a shelter. \u201cIt was devastating, all our hopes were crushed,\u201d said Maya\u2019s mother, Ayala Puder. \u201cI\u2019d never in my worst imagination thought about a situation where I\u2019d have to bury my daughter, and to bury her under those circumstances of her being murdered so brutally.

Eman al-Masri was pregnant when she had to move from northern Gaza to Jabalia refugee camp before finally sheltering in central Gaza, where she gave birth to quadruplets. Her young family now resides in a former school classroom with 50 other families. She said: \u201cThe entire place is not suitable for children, and there is no money even to buy diapers, milk, or anything.\u201d She added: \u2018All of this had an impact on me, on the children who were in my womb, and on my young children.\u201d 00:01:25 Displaced woman gives birth to quadruplets in central Gaza \u2013 video\nUpdated at 20.46 CET\n1 Jan 2024 20.09 CET Israel is withdrawing some of its troops from Gaza as a senior Israeli official said it plans to continue its war across the strip \u2013 which has killed nearly 22,000 Palestinians \u2013 for \u201csix months at least\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Emma Graham-Harrison reports: There is growing international pressure to curb an offensive that has so far killed nearly 22,000 Palestinians in Gaza, most of them women and children. Even Israel\u2019s staunchest ally, the US, which rejects calls for a ceasefire, has started pushing the government to scale back the ferocity of its attacks. Plans to send some reservists home from Gaza, confirmed on New Year\u2019s Eve, mark the start of a new stage in the war, a senior official told Reuters, and may be presented as a partial response to those demands. But Israel still expects heavy fighting in Gaza for much of 2024 as it hunts for senior Hamas leaders, even if there are fewer troops on the ground. \u201cThis will take six months at least, and involve intense mopping-up missions against the terrorists. No one is talking about doves of peace being flown from Shejaiya,\u201d the official said, referring to a Gaza district that has been the scene of heavy battles. Reuters did not identify him by name. Not all of those returned from Gaza will go home. Some would be prepared for rotation to the northern border with Lebanon, amid fears of a wider escalation of the conflict, the official told Reuters.
