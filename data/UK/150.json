A second former general and political rival, Benny Gantz, the leader of National Unity, also joined.\nEisenkot, whose 25-year-old son was killed in December while fighting in Gaza, told the investigative programme Uvda on Israel\u2019s Channel 12 television channel that \u201cthe hostages will only return alive if there is a deal, linked to a significant pause in fighting\u201d.\nHe said dramatic rescue operations like the famous raid that freed more than 200 Israelis held at Entebbe airport in Uganda in 1976 were unlikely because the hostages were apparently spread out, many of them in underground tunnels.\nClaiming hostages could be freed by means other than a deal \u201cis to spread illusions\u201d, he said.\nIn a thinly veiled criticism of Netanyahu, Eisenkot said strategic decisions about the war\u2019s direction must be made urgently, and that a discussion about an endgame should have begun immediately after the war began.\nThe former general also dismissed suggestions that the military had delivered a decisive blow against Hamas. \u201cWhoever speaks of absolute defeat [of Hamas] is not speaking the truth,\u201d Eisenkot said in the interview. \u201cThat is why we should not tell stories \u2026 Today, the situation already in the Gaza Strip is such that the goals of the war have not yet been achieved.\u201d\nEisenkot\u2019s comments late on Thursday were the latest sign of deep disagreement among political and military leaders over the direction of Israel\u2019s offensive on Hamas.\nThe Israeli assault has destroyed much of the Gaza Strip, displacing more than three-quarters of its 2.3 million people and killing 25,000, mostly civilians, according to Palestinian officials.\nCentral to the disputes inside the war cabinet is the question of how to free the more than 130 hostages who remain in Gaza. Not all of them are believed to be alive and there is a growing sense in Israel that time is running out.\nThe arguments are mirrored in wider Israeli society.\nLilach Shoval in Israel Hayom, a rightwing newspaper, wrote: \u201cFifteen weeks have elapsed since Hamas forced this war on Israel on that Black Saturday of October 7, and Israel remains far from achieving the goals it set for itself: toppling Hamas\u2019s military and governing ability, and returning the captives, not necessarily in that order.\u201d Others have described a \u201cquagmire\u201d.\nMairav Zonszein, an Israel analyst with the International Crisis Group, said: \u201cThere is no lack of support for the war but it is increasingly clear that the release of the hostages is in conflict with other goals.\u201d\nA poll published in Ma\u2019ariv newspaper found that if elections were held now, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party would be reduced to 16 of the 120 seats in the national assembly, the Knesset.\nThe US, Israel\u2019s closest ally, has provided strong military and political support for the campaign, but has been increasingly calling on Israel to scale back its assault and accept the establishment of a Palestinian state after the war, a suggestion Netanyahu has soundly rejected.\nSpeaking during a nationally televised news conference Thursday, Netanyahu said that a Palestinian state would become a launchpad for attacks on Israel \u2013 an argument that is popular in Israel.\nIsrael \u201cmust have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River\u201d, Netanyahu said, adding: \u201cThat collides with the idea of sovereignty. What can we do?\u201d\nThe US has said the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority, which governs semi-autonomous zones in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, should be \u201crevitalised\u201d and return to Gaza. Hamas ousted the authority from Gaza in 2007.\nNetanyahu\u2019s opponents accuse him of delaying any discussion of postwar scenarios in order to avoid looming investigations of governmental failures, keep his coalition intact and put off elections.\nWhen asked if Netanyahu might be prolonging the war for political gain, Eisenkot paused before answering: \u201cI hope not.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israeli minister says only ceasefire can free hostages, as cabinet rift deepens", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/19/israeli-minister-says-only-ceasefire-can-free-hostages-as-cabinet-rift-deepens"}
