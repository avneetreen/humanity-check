It also runs a donor-advised fund, a kind of non-profit entity which have been widely criticized for, among other things, concealing flows of \u201cdark money\u201d to rightwing causes.\nThe company hosts crowdfunding campaigns on several separate websites including israelgives.org, fundme.org.il, and israeltoremet.org. In 2020, Ben-Dor was sole founder of Giving Technology Inc, which provides a customer management system for nonprofits.\nThe Guardian identified at least 450 fundraising campaigns that are currently live on the site. Some 204 of these, initiated after 7 October, sought donations for tactical equipment or logistical support. Named beneficiaries included the IDF, individual IDF units, or paramilitary squads attached to specific Israeli communities, including many attached to West Bank settlements.\nThe international community considers West Bank settlements illegal, but the hardline Benjamin Netanyahu government in June announced plans to expand their construction.\nAfter conversion to US dollar amounts at market rates at the time of reporting, the Guardian determined that donors had pledged $5.3m to military, paramilitary or settlers since 7 October. A high proportion of these donors indicated that they are US residents.\nCampaigns raising funds specifically for illegal settlements included campaigns in support of Efrat, Tene (called Tene Omarum by settlers), Shavei Shomron, and Ma\u2019on (also called Havat Ma\u2019on). All of these fundraisers appear to ask for funding for paramilitary units attached to the settlements.\nThe \u201cEmergency Campaign for Havat Ma\u2019on\u2019s Security Team\u201d, for example, is headed by a video which includes footage of armed settlers undergoing combat training. In the copy for the campaign, the settlers promise to \u201cstand firm against the cruel enemy that threatens our existence as Jews in the Land of Israel\u201d, and promises: \u201cWe will do everything to ensure our safe existence here and make it clear to our enemies that we are not to be messed with!\u201d\nThe campaign had raised over $7,700 at the time of reporting, and donors included individuals identifying themselves as residents of US states including Florida, Illinois, New York and Pennsylvania.\nMa\u2019on, founded in 1980, is a 600-person outpost settlement in the extreme south of the occupied West Bank.\nAccording to the Foundation for Middle East Peace: \u201cThe Havat Ma\u2019on outpost has a history of violent harassment of Palestinians working land near the outpost and the settlers\u2019 illegally-built access road.\u201d\nThis has continued in the wake of 7 October.\nOn 13 October, Israeli human rights organization B\u2019Teselem circulated a video of a settler from the community shooting a Palestinian man at point-blank range with an AR-style rile in the neighboring village of Tawani as an IDF soldier looked on. Israeli press outlets corroborated the video.\nThe Guardian contacted IsraelGives to ask if it was concerned about exposing international donors to legal liability, citing the Ma\u2019on fundraiser as a specific example, and founder and CEO Jonathan Ben-Dor responded in an email.\nHe wrote that IsraelGives, \u201cthe main website for giving in Israel\u201d is a \u201cneutral broker, facilitating giving to any of Israel\u2019s 50,000 registered non-profit organizations\u201d.\nBen-dor said that the site supported \u201chuman and civil rights organizations, humanitarian aid projects, and movements for the promotion of democracy, alongside religious and educational activities \u2013 some leftwing, some rightwing (some Jewish, some Arab)\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cWe also facilitate international giving to those non-profits, when the organization and its cause and mission are in compliance with US law (charitable equivalence)\u201d, a reference to IRS guidelines requiring US givers to demonstrate a \u201cgood faith determination that a foreign organization is a qualifying public charity\u201d.\nBen-dor wrote that the Ma\u2019on campaign was \u201ccreated automatically on our platform through a war-time program designed to provide emergency assistance to communities and families directly affected by the October 7th attacks\u201d.\nHe added that \u201cbefore funds are released to any campaign, the campaign and its backers go through an extensive [know your customer] and compliance process.\u201d\nBen-dor concluded that the Ma\u2019on fundraiser \u201chas yet to be vetted, approved, or funded, and on the face of it is not a cause that we will support, for the aforementioned reasons\u201d.\nThe Guardian sent additional questions to Ben-Dor about whether he thought donations to West Bank settlements would not comply with US law, but he did not respond. The Guardian also contacted the IRS with general questions about compliance in such cases, but did not receive a response before deadline.\nBen-dor\u2019s apparent caution runs counter to a longer history in which some say that US donations to Israeli organizations engaged in illegal activities have met few sanctions.\nDiala Shamas is senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), a hunan rights non-profit headquartered in New York City. She said that while donations to communities like Ma\u2019on, \u201care illegal under international law and could be illegal under US law, the problem has always been one of enforcement\u201d.\nShe believes that attorneys-general could prosecute over donations funding illegal acts, and the IRS could enforce its own rules on equivalence, but \u201cIsraeli causes have enjoyed complete impunity\u201d.\nHowever, she pointed to initiatives including the so-called \u201cNot on Our Dime\u201d bill, supported by CCR and other organizations, currently before New York\u2019s state house, which \u201cclarifies that funding Israeli settlement activity \u2026 is illegal\u201d, according to a campaign website.\nOther IsraelGives campaigns sought funds for tactical equipment for regular and reserve units of the IDF, and all have enjoyed contributions from US residents.\nOne had raised $25,443 for the \u201cMaglan Friends Foundation\u201d, which said that donors would \u201ccontribute directly to Maglan, a special forces elite commando unit of the IDF established to operate behind enemy lines\u201d. Another had raised $2,994 for snipers attached to the 906th infantry batallion \u2013 one of six regular infantry divisions fighting in Gaza \u2013 with asks including three DJI Mavic 3 drones. Another began, \u201cThe soldiers of the IDF Multidimensional Unit \u2026 kindly urge you to donate so they can purchase additional specialist tactical gear\u201d to include \u201c22 commando vests\u201d.\nMany of the IDF fundraisers, however, sought money for standard equipment.\nFor example, a fundraiser for reservists in the army\u2019s 636th field intelligence unit pleaded, \u201cwe need access to essential tactical equipment, such as helmets flashlights, and boots\u201d. That unit has reportedly been directly involved in combat in Gaza in recent days.\nLara Friedman, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace and a former diplomat, said that such fundraisers were telling of the strain on Israel\u2019s military. \u201cIt\u2019s December 2023, and it sounds like parts of the IDF are basically begging for basic equipment, which is fascinating,\u201d she said.\nShamas, the civil rights lawyer, said Israel\u2019s \u201crecord of complete impunity\u201d with respect to the enforcement of international law might lull donors into a false sense of security.\n\u201cThis is actually an incredibly risky space to be giving in,\u201d she said, but those giving to Israel did not appear subject to \u201cthe level of risk assessment that people have to make when they\u2019re giving in other high-risk places, whether it\u2019s Somalia, Afghanistan, or Palestinians in Gaza\u201d.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Revealed: how US residents are funding illegal settlements in the West Bank", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/23/crowdfunding-us-residents-fund-settlements-west-bank"}
