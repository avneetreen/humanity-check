The attack in Kerman killed at least 84 people and wounded an additional 284 at a ceremony honoring Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\nLast month, Iran accused Israel of killing a high-ranking Iranian general, Seyed Razi Mousavi, in an airstrike on a Damascus neighborhood.\nAn Iraqi security official said Irbil was targeted with \u201cseveral\u201d ballistic missiles but did not give further details. An official with an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia said 10 missiles fell in the area near the U.S. consulate. He said the missiles were launched by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity.\nA U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that had not been made public said the U.S. tracked the missiles, which hit in northern Iraq and northern Syria, and no U.S. facilities were struck or damaged in the attacks. The official said initial indications were that the strike were \u201creckless and imprecise.\u201d\nIn 2022, Iran claimed responsibility for a missile barrage that struck in the same area near the sprawling U.S. consulate complex in Irbil, saying it was retaliation for an Israeli strike in Syria that killed two members of its Revolutionary Guard.\nThe strikes come at a time of heightened tensions in the region and fears of a wider spillover of the ongoing war in Gaza.\nSince the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7, Iranian-backed militias in Iraq have launched near-daily drone attacks on bases housing U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, which the groups have said was in retaliation for Washington\u2019s support of Israel, and in an attempt to force U.S. troops to leave the region.\n\u2014\u2014-\nAssociated Press staff writers Tara Copp in Washington and Abby Sewell in Beirut contributed to this report.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Iran strikes targets in northern Iraq and Syria as regional tensions escalate", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/ap-iran-iraq-syria-irbil-b2479176.html"}
