The newspaper said he was from the town of Zichron Yaakov.\nNeedham is thought to be the second British national to have been killed serving with the IDF during or after the 7 October attacks. The first was 20-year-old Nathanel Young.\nThe IDF said Needham was killed in close combat after his unit entered a building and encountered Hamas militants.\nIt said Sgt Ben Zussman was also killed and that another two soldiers were wounded.\nNeedham\u2019s sister, Orly, was quoted by Haaretz as saying her brother was \u201cso proud\u201d to be fighting with the IDF. \u201cHe had just finished basic training. He was happy to defend the country,\u201d she said.\nAfter his death, Needham was promoted to the rank of sergeant.\nThe IDF said 75 soldiers have now been killed in operations in Gaza since 7 October, not including the personnel killed in the attacks themselves.\nFriday saw Israeli operations in Gaza resume after the end of a seven-day ceasefire during which more than 100 hostages had been released and the flow of aid into the territory had increased.\nOn Monday, civilians in about 20 areas of central Gaza were told to move further south, with maps posted online for people to access via smartphones.\nIsraeli tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were also seen moving down the main north-to-south road in Gaza near the southern city of Khan Younis.\nThis movement came after Brig Gen Hisham Ibrahim, the commander of Israel\u2019s armoured corps, said the goals of Israeli forces in northern Gaza had \u201calmost been met\u201d.\nGaza\u2019s health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, says more than 15,500 people, about 70% of them women and children, have so far been killed in the territory.\nSpeaking on Saturday at his first press conference since fighting resumed, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the war would continue \u201cuntil we achieve all its aims\u201d.\nHe added that the temporary ceasefire had allowed Israel\u2019s soldiers to prepare for \u201ctotal victory\u201d over Hamas.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "British national, 19, killed while fighting for IDF in Gaza", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/04/british-national-19-killed-while-fighting-for-idf-in-gaza"}
