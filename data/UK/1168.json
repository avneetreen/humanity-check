About 2,700 people have been reported missing.\nMore than 1,200 people in Israel died, most of them in the Hamas attack, and about 240 hostages were taken from Israel into Gaza by Palestinian militants.\nCurrently:\n\u2014 Thousands flee Gaza's main hospital but hundreds, including babies, still trapped by fighting\n\u2014 Hospitals have special protection under the rules of war.

This would signal a significant departure since the weekend when Gaza health officials had said about 1,500 patients, along with 1,500 medical workers and 15,000 displaced people were at Shifa.\nIsraeli forces and Hamas gunmen have waged heavy battles outside Shifa, and some hospital officials have said Shifa was under siege, with those inside being pinned down by Israeli fire. Israel has said it had offered safe passage to those wanting to leave.\nThe situation at Shifa deteriorated over the weekend, with doctors reporting that the last generator had run out of fuel, leading to the deaths of several patients, including premature babies.\nThe U.N. official said Monday that many of the displaced fled the compound and that some families took relatives with moderate injuries with them. He said remaining patients require special procedures for evacuation including equipped ambulances to take them to Egyptian hospitals. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Samy Magdy contributed.\nISRAEL BLOCKS HEZBOLLAH-AFFILIATED, BEIRUT-BASED TV CHANNEL\nJERUSALEM \u2014 The Israeli government has blocked the Hezbollah-affiliated, Beirut-based Al Mayadeen TV news channel from broadcasting in Israel.\n\u201cBroadcasts that identify with the enemy are harmful to the state\u2019s security and should be blocked,\u201d Communciations Minister Shlomo Karhi wrote in a joint statement with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\nLast month, the government approved emergency regulations allowing it to block the wartime operations of foreign channels it deems hostile to the state. Karhi had also pressed to shut down the Israeli office of Qatar-based Al Jazeera, but Doha is leading efforts to release hostages captured from southern Israel during Hamas\u2019 bloody Oct. 7 incursion, and the Israeli government hasn\u2019t moved ahead on his plan.\nWHO DIRECTOR-GENERAL SAYS SHIFA \u2018NOT FUNCTIONING AS A HOSPITAL\u2019\nBEIRUT \u2014 World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN agency was in contact with Shifa Hospital late Sunday, which he said had been without electricity and water for three days.\n\u201cThe constant gunfire and bombings in the area have exacerbated the already critical circumstances,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cRegrettably, the hospital is not functioning as a hospital anymore.\u201d\nSeveral charities and humanitarian agencies that support Shifa have told The Associated Press they were unable to reach the hospital throughout the day.\nMORE FOREIGN NATIONALS EVACUATED FROM GAZA\nBUCHAREST, Romania \u2014 A group of 86 Romanian citizens were evacuated on Sunday from the Gaza Strip into Egypt, Romania\u2019s Foreign Ministry said.\nThe latest group of evacuees left Gaza through the Rafah border crossing and were on their way to Cairo, it said.
