Buoyed by the first successful rescue of a captive held by Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected calls for a cease-fire and again vowed to crush the militant group\u2019s ability to govern Gaza or threaten Israel.\nMore than half of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million Palestinians have fled their homes, with hundreds of thousands sheltering in packed U.N.-run schools-turned-shelters or in hospitals alongside thousands of wounded patients.\nThe Palestinian death toll in the Israel-Hamas war has reached 8,306, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. In the occupied West Bank, more than 122 Palestinians have been killed in violence and Israeli raids.\nMore than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, most of them civilians slain in the initial Hamas rampage that started the fighting Oct. 7. In addition, 240 hostages were taken from Israel into Gaza by the militant group. One of the captives, a female Israeli soldier, was rescued in a special forces operation.\nCurrently:\n1. A UN envoy says the Israel-Hamas war is spilling into Syria, adding to instability there\n2. UN agency in Gaza says urgent cease-fire is a matter of life and death for Palestinians\n3. An Israeli ministry proposes transferring Gaza civilians to Egypt\u2019s Sinai\n4. This war might hit Israel\u2019s economy harder than past wars with Hamas\n5.

We are masters of our fate. Today we put on our lapels the blue and white flag (of Israel), not a yellow patch.\u201d\nNazis forced Jews to wear yellow six-pointed Star of David patches during the Holocaust.\nAmbassador Gilad Erdan donned the patch during a council meeting on the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, where more than 8,300 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, hundreds of thousands have been displaced, and food and basic supplies have dwindled sharply since Israel went to war against the Palestinian territory\u2019s Hamas rulers.\nErdan told the Security Council that he would wear the patch, inscribed with the words \u201cNever Again,\u201d until the council condemns Hamas\u2019s bloody Oct. 7 incursion into southern Israel, which touched off the war. More than 1,400 people were killed and about 240 taken hostage during the attack.\nBIDEN ADMINISTRATION URGES IMMEDIATE AID FOR ISRAEL AND UKRAINE\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken will make the case Tuesday that the United States should immediately send aid to Israel and Ukraine, testifying at a Senate hearing as the administration\u2019s massive $105 billion emergency aid request for conflicts in those countries and others has already hit roadblocks in the divided Congress.\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s Cabinet secretaries will be advocating for the foreign aid to a mostly friendly audience in the Senate, where majority Democrats and many Republicans support tying aid for the two countries together. But it faces much deeper problems in the Republican-led House, where new Speaker Mike Johnson has proposed cutting out the Ukraine aid and focusing on Israel alone, and cutting money for the Internal Revenue Service to pay for it.\nThe drastically narrowed House proposal, which would cost more than $14 billion, faced immediate resistance among Senate Democrats -- and put pressure on Senate Republicans who support the Ukraine aid but are conscious of growing concerns about it within their party. The differing approaches signal problems ahead for the aid as both countries engage in long-simmering, defining conflicts that Biden and many U.S. lawmakers say could have fundamental ramifications for the rest of the world.\nCANADA SAYS HUMANITARIAN ACCORD URGENTLY NEEDED\nTORONTO \u2014 Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly said Monday that a humanitarian agreement is urgently needed to help people in the Gaza Strip.\nSpeaking to the Economic Club of Canada, Joly called for a temporary pause in hostilities in the Israel-Hamas war to allow more aid to get into Gaza.\n\"The humanitarian situation facing the Palestinian people, facing Palestinian women and children, is dire,\u201d she said.\nJoly reiterated Canada\u2019s unequivocal condemnation of Hamas for its attacks on Israelis and said Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorism ``in accordance with international law.\u2033 She also criticized attacks by extremist Israelis on Palestinians in the West Bank.\nUNWRA HEAD SAYS CIVIL ORDER BREAKDOWN ENDANGERS AGENCY'S OPERATIONS\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees is warning that \u201can immediate humanitarian cease-fire has become a matter of life and death for millions,\u201d stressing that \u201cthe present and future of Palestinians and Israelis depend on it.\u201d\nPhilippe Lazzarini warned during an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Monday that a further breakdown of civil order, following the recent break-ins at the agency's warehouses by panicked Palestinians searching for food and other aid, will make it extremely difficult for the largest U.N. agency in Gaza to continue operating.\nHe said in a virtual briefing that he is worried about a spillover of the conflict and urged all 193 U.N. member nations \u201cto change the trajectory of this crisis.\"\nThe commissioner-general of the agency known as UNRWA, also said 64 of its staff have been killed in just over three weeks \u2014 the latest only two hours prior when UNRWA\u2019s head of security in mid-Gaza was killed with his wife and eight children.\nLazzarini said most Palestinians in Gaza \u201cfeel trapped in a war they have nothing to do with\u201d and \u201cthey feel the world is equating all of them to Hamas.\u201d He stressed that the Oct. 7 Hamas atrocities in Israel don\u2019t absolve Israel from its obligations under international humanitarian law, starting with the protection of civilians.\nISRAEL BACKTRACKS ON REFUSING TO GRANT ENTRY VISAS TO UN OFFICIALS\nGENEVA \u2014 Israeli officials are going back on their promised refusal to grant entry visas to U.N. officials.\nMartin Griffiths, the head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, tweeted Monday that he was in Israel \u2014 less than a week after Israel\u2019s U.N. ambassador said it had \u201crefused\u201d to grant Griffiths a visa.\nIsraeli officials had expressed outrage over comments last Wednesday by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that the deadly Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants \u201cdid not happen in a vacuum.\u201d\nGilad Erdan, Israel\u2019s U.N. ambassador, accused Guterres on Israel\u2019s Army Radio of justifying a slaughter, called for his resignation and said Israel would \u201crefuse to grant visas to U.N. representatives.\u201d\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Guterres stood by his remarks.\nOn Monday, Israel\u2019s ambassador in Geneva, Meirav Eilon Shahar, said, \u201cWe haven\u2019t said categorically that we\u2019re not giving visas. We are \u2026 We understand their need to be there.\u201d\nEilon Shahar confirmed that Griffiths was in Israel, as well as other officials, including Han Kluge, the regional head of the World Health Organization.\nBut she continued to voice Israel\u2019s frustration that U.N. institution chiefs didn\u2019t speak out more forcefully against Hamas militants for \u201cbutchering civilians and women in such a vicious way.\u201d\n\u201cThe United Nations has let down the people of Israel,\u201d Eilon Shahar added. \u201cWhen I say the United Nations, I\u2019m talking about the multilateral organizations have let down the people of Israel.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Live updates | Israeli ground forces attack Hamas targets in north as warplanes strike across Gaza", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/hamas-ap-gaza-israeli-gilad-erdan-b2438939.html"}
