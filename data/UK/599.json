Commercial aircraft is expected to remain dominant as well as the fastest-growing aircraft type in the market during the forecast period. The dominance of the segment is led by the requirement for the most fasteners in the aircraft type, owing to its larger and more complex structure than other types of aircraft. The increasing production rate of key aircraft programs such as the B737 and A320, the entry of new aircraft manufacturers in the market, which includes COMAC and Irkut, and the rising fleet size of aircraft are expected to drive market growth during the forecast period.\nBased on the material type - The aircraft screws market is segmented into titanium, steel, and other materials. Titanium is likely to remain the dominant as well as the fastest-growing material type in the aircraft screws market over the next five years, propelled by the increasing usage of titanium in the manufacturing of screws by replacing traditional steel and aluminum screws. Titanium offers a significant weight-saving advantage along with excellent corrosion resistance as compared to other competing materials.\nBased on the application type - The aircraft screws market is segmented into airframe, engine, flight control surfaces, interiors, and others. Airframe is projected to remain the biggest demand generator for screws in an aircraft during the forecast. The fuselage and wings cover a large surface area and have thousands of screws deployed in them, which makes the airframe the most dominant segment.\nBased on the end-user type - The market is bifurcated into OE and aftermarket sales. OE sales are likely to remain the larger as well as faster-growing segment of the market during the forecast period. A large number of screws are required during the production of aircraft. Increasing aircraft production would contribute to the growth of the market during the forecast period.\nTo know the attractive segments, click here for a free sample pdf:\nhttps://www.stratviewresearch.com/Request-Sample/476/aircraft-screws-market.html#form\nWhich Region Offers the Best Opportunity and Growth?\nThe report suggests that North America is expected to remain the largest market for aircraft screws during the forecast period. This growth is majorly attributed to the following \u2013\n- The region is the manufacturing capital of the aircraft industry with the presence of several large- to small-sized aircraft OEMs, tier players, screw manufacturers, and distributors.\n- The USA is not only the largest market for aircraft screws in North America but also in the world. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Bell Helicopter, Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, and The Cessna Aircraft Company are some of the major OEMs in the USA, which generate a healthy demand for screws in the country.\nLikewise, the Asia-Pacific is likely to depict the highest growth during the same period, owing to the growing demand for screws fueled by the establishment of new manufacturing sites of aircraft OEM and tier players in the region. China and India are the growth engines of the Asia-Pacific's aircraft screws market. These economies keep on generating high demand for commercial aircraft to support the rising passenger traffic.\nAircraft Screws Market Drivers\nSome of the key reasons that are propelling the growth of the market include-\nPlacement of a large number of aircraft orders fueled by an incessant increase in air passenger traffic.\nIncreasing production rates of the key aircraft programs, such as the A320neo, B737 Max, A220, B787, and A350XWB.\nRising global aircraft fleet size.\nIncreasing demand for lightweight and corrosion-resistant screws.\nFor Customization or Any Other Queries, Get in Touch with Our Industry Experts- at sales@stratviewresearch.com\nTop 5 Companies in the Aircraft Screws Market?\nThe market is moderately concentrated, with the presence of some key regional and global players.
