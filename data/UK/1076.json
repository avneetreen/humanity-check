Makeshift labs have since sprung up in Mexico to receive the precursor chemicals from Asia, mix them or press them into pills, and smuggle them into the US\nHomeless San Francisco denizen Travis Hayes, 65, holds up a bag believed to be fentanyl\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates there were 109,673 overdose deaths in the year to April 2022 \u2014 a new record. Many were due to fentanyl, pictured\n'China's word on international agreements cannot be trusted,' she added.\n'Like how it violates foundational UN agreements on atrocity crimes, this deal on fentanyl could turn out to be empty promises.'\nChina's embassy in Washington declined to comment on the fentanyl issue.\nChinese state media has repeatedly said addiction and demand for the drug are US domestic problems.\nStill, US officials say that small chemical firms in China make precursor chemicals that are shipped to Mexico to produce illicit fentanyl.\nThe opioid, which is 50-100 times stronger than heroin, is often mixed with other illegal drugs, sold as powders and nasal sprays, and increasingly turned into pills that look like legitimate prescription opioids.\nThese are then smuggled across the US-Mexico border, the officials say.\nDEA officers seized a million fake pills containing fentanyl at a home in Inglewood, California. The drug is so potent that users can easily take a lethal dose\nDrugs and paraphernalia recovered from a bust in New York in September 2016, in which officers made a record seizure of 33 kilograms of heroin and 2 kilograms of fentanyl from a drug ring encompassing New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Arizona and New Jersey\nThis image from Mexico's national defense forces shows a makeshift drugs lab in northwest Mexico, where officers discovered precursor chemicals, fentanyl paste, weapons and drug making gear, from November 2021\nLast month, Washington slapped sanctions on 28 people and entities involved with the international proliferation of illicit drugs, including a large China-based network.\nThe US rate of drug overdose deaths involving fentanyl more than tripled from 2016 through 2021, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nTens of thousands of people die annually from synthetic opioid overdoses, government statistics show.\n'We know that this global fentanyl supply chain, which ends with the deaths of Americans, often starts with chemical companies in China,' said US Attorney General Merrick Garland.\nAhead of the summit in San Francisco, state and local officials have tried to clean up drugs from the city's streets, with limited success.\nThe crisis has drawn sharp criticism from residents in the city, where drug-fuelled crime has forced some businesses to leave.\nWith Reuters.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "EXCLUSIVE: China's Uyghurs slam Biden for selling out the oppressed minority by lifting curbs on a blacklisted forensics lab in return for Xi's 'empty promises' on cutting fentanyl flows", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12754549/Chinas-Uyghurs-Biden-oppressed-minority-blacklisted-forensics-lab-Xis-promise-fentanyl.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"}
