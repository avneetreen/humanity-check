Ori Megidish. Hamas had earlier released Americans Judith Raanan, 59, and her daughter, Natalie, 18. Also let go were Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, along with Nurit Cooper, 79. Their husbands remain in captivity.\nHamas has said it would let the others go in return for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, which has dismissed the offer.\nHere are stories of some of the more than 200 still held in captivity.\nBIBAS FAMILY\nLARNACA, Cyprus \u2014 Ofri Bibas couldn\u2019t bring herself to tell her brother, Yarden, she loved him when his home came under attack, fearing that might signal some kind of irreversible finality, she said.\nYarden Bibas, his wife, Shiri, and their sons, 4-year-old Ariel and 9-month-old Kfir, were snatched from their home in the Nir-Oz Kibbutz during the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught.\nHer brother initially believed the volley of rocket fire was \u201cjust another bombing like we\u2019re used to,\u201d said Ofri Bibas, who lives elsewhere in Israel.\nBut he soon realized it was \u201csomething much bigger and much worse,\" she said, speaking earlier this month at a rally in support of Israel in Larnaca, Cyprus, that she and other relatives of the hostages attended to raise attention to their loved ones' plights.\nOfri Bibas said she communicated with her brother in a flurry of texts as the Hamas gunmen roamed around outside his home. She said her brother and his wife did their best to keep their sons quiet.\n\u201cTry to imagine keeping a 9-month-old and a 4-year-old kid quiet so the terrorists won\u2019t come in,\u201d she said.\nYarden Bibas told his sister he had a gun in the house, but couldn\u2019t use it to defend his family against so many gunmen armed with automatic rifles.\nThen her brother said he loved her. But Ofri Bibas didn\u2019t respond she loved him too. \u201cI just said, \u2018Shut up it\u2019s going to be okay, shut up. Just be quiet and follow the security and everything will be all right.\u2019\u201d\nLater that night, Yarden sent a final text that the gunmen had entered the family's home.\nOfri Bibas said she and her family learned that Shiri and the boys were taken by Hamas through a video released by the Islamic militants on social media. Later, Hamas released an image showing her wounded brother held by his throat by a militant holding a hammer in his other hand.\nOfri Bibas said every time she hears children playing, she thinks of her little nephew, Kfir, hungry and afraid.\n\u201cThey must be terrified. We just ask everyone to help us bring them back home,\u201d she said.\n\u2014 Menelaos Hadjicostis\nOmer Neutra\nA small forest of candles melted into the chocolate icing of a birthday cake in New York\u2019s Long Island last week, but the guest of honor wasn\u2019t there.\nOmer Neutra, an Israeli soldier, turned 22 seven days after Hamas \u2032 attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Israeli officials told his parents that Hamas took Neutra and his unit hostage, Orna and Ronen Neutra said in a telephone interview. They were told he was seen on video footage released by Hamas.\nAt their home in the U.S. on Oct. 14, the family took a break from doing what they can to secure Omer\u2019s release by celebrating his birthday. They did not blow out the candle flames, because, they said, Omer wasn\u2019t there to do so.\nThe scene is a glimpse of the difficult limbo in which the Neutras find themselves as they and the families of more than 200 other Israeli hostages \u2014 and dozens more people who remain missing \u2014 await word on their loved ones\u2019 fates, with hope.\n\u201cOmer is tough,\u201d said his dad, Ronen. \u201cWe feel that he is well.\u201d\nOmer Neutra was born in Manhattan a month after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the son of Israeli-born parents. Also a dual citizen, he attended a conservative Jewish school and \u201cknew all of the statistics of the New York Knicks,\u201d Ronen said.\nHe lists Omer\u2019s leadership positions as captain of the basketball, soccer and volleyball teams at the Schechter School of Long Island, as well as a regional president of United Synagogue Youth. Omer, Ronen said, was offered admission to the State University of New York at Binghamton \u2014 but instead deferred, took a gap year and then moved to Israel to join the army.\nThe Neutras last spoke to their son on Oct. 6, the night before the incursion, as he patrolled the Gaza border. Omer was looking forward to Shabbat, which on that weekend was also the start of a weeklong celebration of the harvest season in Israel.\n\u201cHe was tired \u2014 motivated but tired \u2014 after a few weeks of lots of action on the border,\u201d Ronen said. \u201cHe was hoping for a peaceful weekend to relax a little bit.\u201d\n\u2014 Laurie Kellman\nHaran family\nFor days after the brutal Hamas attack, Shaked Haran sought any clues she could about the fate of her missing parents, sister, little niece and nephew, two aunts, an uncle, a cousin \u2014 10 family members in all, spanning three generations.\nThere were strong signs that at least some had been taken hostage. Her parents\u2019 house at Kibbutz Be\u2019eri was burned but the shelter was intact and there were no bodies found in it. Phone locations were tracked to Gaza. Haran\u2019s brother-in-law had been seen being put in a Hamas car. And after a friend called the father\u2019s phone more than 100 times, someone finally answered in Arabic and then referred in Hebrew to a hostage situation.\nIf captivity was a terrible outcome, the alternative would be worse.\nBut earlier this week, Haran, a 34-year-old attorney who grew up on the kibbutz but now lives in Beersheba, got the devastating news that the body of her father, Avshalom Haran, had been identified \u2014 he\u2019d died in the terrible violence at Be\u2019eri. The news came shortly after her uncle, Eviatar Kipnis, had also been confirmed dead.\nNow, Haran can only pray her other relatives are alive \u2014 and tell the world their stories. They include her mother, Shoshan, a longtime social activist who founded the nonprofit Fair Planet, which works to fight food insecurity in the developing world by helping farmers.\n\u201cShe\u2019s really dedicated her time to this, trying to get as many people out of the poverty cycle as possible,\u201d Haran said, adding that her family had been committed to peace, with many active in peace organizations, and raised her \u201cto think about the person on the other side of the situation.\u201d\nAlso missing: Haran\u2019s sister, Adi, a psychologist; her husband Tal and their children Naveh, 8, \u201ca bright, open-hearted boy that makes friends in an instant,\u201d and Yahel, 3, \u201ccreative and full of life.\u201d Also believed abducted are Haran\u2019s aunt, Sharon, her 12-year-old daughter, Noam, and another aunt, Lilach Kipnis.\nAsked if she has a message on behalf of her family, Haran preferred to speak about all the hostages and victims.\n\u201cI love my family, but they\u2019re one small story in this huge catastrophe,\u201d Haran said. \u201cThey\u2019d want the message to be that they\u2019re part of the family of the kibbutz \u2013 and the family of Israel.\u201d\n\u2014 Jocelyn Noveck\nOr and Eynav Levy\nFor at least a week, 2-year-old Almog Levy has been asking for his mom and dad, and no one knows what to tell him.\nHis parents, Or and Eynav Levy, did everything together. They kept a tent in their car for spontaneous road trips, and they recently took a family trip to Thailand. They also loved music festivals, and drove to the Tribe of Nova festival in the Israeli desert.\nThey arrived minutes before Hamas militants carried out the deadliest civilian massacre in Israeli history. Eynav Elkayam Levy, 32, was confirmed dead. Or, 33, is missing.\n\u201cHow can you tell a 2-year-old boy he won\u2019t see his mother anymore?\u201d said Or\u2019s older brother, Michael Levy. The family is stuck between heartbreak and hope, and they pray that Or makes it home alive.\nPhotos from happier times show the couple beaming at the beach and cafes.\n\u201cOr is always smiling, always happy, not just in the pictures,\u201d said Michael Levy, 40, who thinks of his brother as a child genius who would would break things so he could fix them. Or taught himself computer programming and is part of a successful startup, and he and Eynav dreamed of having a bigger family.\nA patchwork of text messages captures the couple\u2019s chaotic final minutes together. Eynav texted her mother, who was babysitting Almog, shortly after daybreak to say they\u2019d arrived at the festival site.\nSoon after, Or texted his mother to say they were driving back home. It was 6:51 a.m. and sirens were sounding as Hamas rockets flew over the desert party.\nOr\u2019s mother texted back: \u201cWatch out and call me when you can.\u201d He called at 7:39 a.m. to say they were hiding in a bomb shelter. She asked how they were. \u201cMom, you don\u2019t want to know,\u201d he replied, before phone service cut off. The family hasn\u2019t heard from him since.\nSeveral days later, the Israeli army informed the family that Eynav\u2019s body was found inside the shelter, and that Or had been kidnapped and taken hostage. The family has no other details.\nAlmog\u2019s grandparents are taking turns watching the boy, Michael said. They are trying to stay positive, for Almog\u2019s sake. \u201cHe is calling out for his mom and dad all the time.\u201d\n\u2014 Jocelyn Gecker\nSagui Dekel-Chen\nSagui Dekel-Chen is a builder of things. He's as gifted with his hands as he is at managing community development projects, his father says.\nEarly on the morning of Oct. 7, Sagui was tinkering with an engine in the machine shop at Nir Oz, in southern Israel, when he saw intruders on the grounds and sounded the alarm. After running home, he rigged the door of the safe room so it couldn\u2019t be opened from the outside, kissed his pregnant wife and told her to lock herself and their two daughters inside.\nThen the 35-year-old father borrowed a gun and tried to protect his community. He hasn\u2019t been seen since. His family believes that the Israeli-American, like several members of the kibbutz, was abducted by the Hamas militants.\n\u201cThis is a guy who has so much to give,\u2019\u2019 said his father, Jonathan Dekel-Chen. \u201cHe\u2019s already proven it. Ironically not just to Israelis and his family, his children, but to all of our neighbors.\u201d\nSagui Dekel-Ch is a project manager for the U.K. branch of the Jewish National Fund, organizing the construction of schools and youth centers in the underdeveloped Negev Desert. That included collaboration with both Jewish and Muslim nonprofits that worked in Arab communities near the kibbutz.\n\u201cEvery day was something different. Every day he was helping other people make their nonprofit goals come alive,\u201d his father said.\nThe work was an avenue for Sagui Dekel-Chen\u2019s \u201cextraordinary creativity\u201d as he advised non-profits, launched his own projects and built coalitions to get things done, his father said.\n\u201cIt is a crime that Hamas has made it so that Palestinian people will never be able, I fear, to benefit themselves from my son and people like him because their brains have been poisoned,\u201d he added.\n\u2014 Danica Kirka\nRomi Gonen\nMeirav Leshem Gonen says she feels like she has failed to do her job as a mother to protect her 23-year-old daughter, Romi Gonen, who vanished on the day Hamas unleashed its onslaught inside Israel.\nSpeaking in Cyprus at a support rally for Israel, Gonen fought back tears as she recounted her daughter\u2019s frantic call from an outdoor music festival and her description of missiles falling followed by volleys of automatic gunfire.\n\u201cWe assumed, OK, a few terrorists, the army will come and everything will be finished in a few minutes,\" Gonen said. \u201cBut the shooting kept on and on, and we are on the phone hearing the shootings, and Romi is terrified.\u201d\nGonen and her eldest daughter spent nearly five hours speaking to Romi, who told them that roads clogged with abandoned cars made escape impossible and that she would instead seek shelter in some bushes to hide from roaming Hamas gunmen.\n\u201cShe\u2019s afraid and she has to hide from bush to bush so the terrorists will not find her. Just imagine where she was, what she felt,\u201d Gonen said.\nAmid the carnage a ray of hope emerged, as a friend who rescued a few other revelers went back in search of Romi and her friends.\nBut then, the call came that changed everything. \u201cMommy I was shot, the car was shot, everybody was shot. \u2026 I am wounded and bleeding. Mommy, I think I\u2019m going to die,\u201d said Romi.\nTrying to lift her daughter\u2019s spirits, Gonen told Romi as if by command that she wasn\u2019t going to die, to stop crying, start breathing and to treat her wounded friends.\n\u201cAnd they knew I was lying because I didn\u2019t have anything, anything I could do to help her,\u201d Gonen said.\n\u201cIf I cannot help her, I will tell her how much I love her. She\u2019s my kid. I wanted her to remember my words, and then told her how much I love her and how much she\u2019s loved, and what we will do when she comes back home.\u201d\nRomi\u2019s last word during the call was \u201cMommy,\u201d as approaching gunfire and the men's shouts drowned out everything.\nThen the phone shut off.\nGonen said she thinks she's a strong mother, \"But I feel that I didn\u2019t do my job. And since that day, all I do is make sure that nobody will forget Romi and any others of the kidnapped.\u201d\n\u2014 Menelaos Hadjicostis\nJudith Weinstein and Gad Haggai\nJudih Weinstein and her husband, Gad Haggai, were on their morning walk when gunfire erupted and missiles streaked across the sky. Taking cover in a field, they could hear a recorded voice from an alert system for their kibbutz in southern Israel.\n\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d Weinstein, 70, asked in Hebrew as she captured the scene on video.\n\u201cRed alert,\u201d her 72-year-old husband said.\nWeinstein shared the 40-second video clip in a group chat Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Kibbutz Nir Oz. That has been their last contact with their family.\nMore than a week later, Weinstein and Haggai are still missing. Their family used the video to pinpoint the couple\u2019s last known location and shared it with the Israeli army, but a search came up empty. Their fate remains a mystery to their four grown children.\nA daughter, Iris Weinstein Haggai, has been relentlessly looking for answers from her home in Singapore. The family heard ominous news from a paramedic, who said Weinstein had called for medical help.\n\u201cShe said they were shot by terrorists on a motorcycle and that my dad was wounded really bad,\u201d said Weinstein Haggai, 38. \u201cParamedics tried to send her an ambulance. The ambulance got hit by a rocket.\u201d\nThe paramedic lost contact with Weinstein, leaving her family grappling with worst-case scenarios.\nHaggai is a retired chef and jazz musician. Weinstein, a New York native, is a retired teacher. Both are pacifists who raised their children at the kibbutz, where everybody knows their neighbors.\n\u2014 Michael Kunzelman\nYaffa Adar\nYaffa Adar loved reading, writing and keeping connected. Even at 85 she often sent her family messages and GIFs on WhatsApp. She was active on Facebook, her granddaughter recalls.\nKeeping in close touch online became especially important in recent years as she found it harder to walk beyond her home in Nir Oz. Amid that physical struggle, she kept her mind busy and knew what she wanted, her granddaughter said.\n\u201cShe loved reading,\u201d Adva Adar recalled. \u201cSo we were like, \u201dWe\u2019re going to get you a Kindle.\u201d What did her grandmother say? \"\u2018No, I like the smell of the paper in books.\u2019\u201d\nWhen Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 massacre at Nir Oz ended and no one could find Adar, her family worried. That concern turned to horror when video surfaced showing her being driven in a golf cart in Gaza, wrapped in a pink flowered blanket.\nThe footage was among the first evidence that Hamas fighters had not only killed Israelis \u2014 more than 1,400, the vast majority civilians \u2014 but had dragged dozens back to Gaza regardless of age in the most complex hostage crisis the country has ever faced.\nSome people speculated that Yaffa Adar\u2019s unflinching demeanor in the video perhaps meant she didn\u2019t understand what was happening.\nNot her family, which includes three children, eight grandchildren and seven great-grandkids.\n\u201cShe absolutely knew what was going on around her. She wasn\u2019t going to panic,\u201d her granddaughter said.\nWhat\u2019s frightening now is that her grandmother doesn\u2019t have her medication for blood pressure and chronic pain.\n\u201cShe was really the glue of our family. She loved her life,\u201d Adva Adar recalls. \u201cShe liked good food and she liked good wine. She was very young-minded.\u201d\n\u2014 Laurie Kellman\nRoni Eshel\nRoni Eshel, a 19-year-old Israel Defense Forces soldier, was stationed at a military base near the Gaza border when Hamas attacked. Although she didn\u2019t answer her phone when her mother called to check on her that morning, she later texted to say that she was busy but OK.\n\u201cI love you so much,\u201d Eshel told her mother, Sharon, about three hours after the attack started.\nHer parents haven\u2019t heard from her since. More than a week later, Eshel\u2019s family is desperate to know happened to their daughter. Her father, Eyal Eshel, describes the wait for news as \u201chell.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know what to think, actually. Where is she? What is she eating? If it\u2019s cold for her? If it\u2019s hot? I don\u2019t know nothing,\u201d Eyal Eshel said.\nHer father says IDF has told them she is considered missing; he believes she has been kidnapped.\n\u201cOtherwise, where is she?\u201d he asked.\nEshel grew up in a small village north of Tel Aviv. She reported for military service two weeks after finishing school. She was three months into her second year of mandatory military service.\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of our life here in Israel,\u201d her father says.\nRoni Eshel was in a communications unit at a base near Nahal Oz. She had returned to the base from a brief vacation on the Wednesday before the attack.\nEshel was proud to be a third generation of her family to join the Israeli military. Her father, uncle and grandfather also served.\n\u201cShe was very happy to serve the country,\u201d her father said.\nHer father said she has planned to travel and enroll in a university after completing her two years of service. But he can\u2019t think about her future while she\u2019s missing. Eyal Eshel says he isn\u2019t sleeping, eating or working while he waits.\n\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed to ask (for) help. Please help us,\u201d he said.\n\u2014 Michael Kunzelman\nMaya and Itay Regev\n\u201cMom, I\u2019ll unpack my suitcase when I get back,\u201d Maya Regev told her mother that Friday night, in a rush to get going. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d\nAnd within a half-hour of returning to Israel from a family trip overseas, 21-year-old Maya and her brother Itay, 18, were on their way to the Tribe of Nova music festival, planning to dance the night away.\nIt was a typical activity for the duo, who both love to be on the move, gather with friends, and especially to travel, said their parents, Ilan and Mirit Regev. Maya had already bought her ticket for an extended trip to South America in December.\nBut early the next morning, Ilan Regev\u2019s phone rang. It was a frantic Maya. \u201cDad, they shot me, they shot me!\u201d she screamed in a recording the family has released. \u201cHe is killing us, Dad, he is killing us.\u201d\nHer father begged her to send her location, to find a place to hide. \u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d he said.\nIlan Regev jumped in his car from his home in Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, and sped south to the festival site, where he was barred from entering. Soon, the Regev family discovered a Hamas video that showed Itay in captivity in Gaza.\nMaya was not pictured, but the army has told the family both were hostages in Gaza. Officials gave no further information.\n\u201cI want to know that my kids are alive,\u201d said Ilan Regev. Added their mother: \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they are eating. We don\u2019t know if they are drinking. If they are hurt.\u201d\n\u2014 Jocelyn Noveck\nHersh Goldberg-Polin\nHis mother describes Hersh Goldberg-Polin as like a lot of other young people.\nThe 23-year-old from Jerusalem loves music, wants to see the world and, now that he\u2019s finished his military service, has plans to go to university, his family says. But first he has to come home.\nGoldberg-Polin was last seen on Oct. 7, when Hamas militants loaded him into the back of a pickup with other hostages abducted from the music festival where at least 260 people were killed.\nDespite those harrowing accounts, his mother, Rachel Goldberg, holds out hope she will see him again.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a survivor,\u201d Goldberg said of her son, whose grin beams out from behind a sparse, youthful beard in family photos. \u201cHe\u2019s not like this big, bulky guy. But I think that survival has a lot to do with where you are mentally.\u201d\nBorn in Berkeley, California, Goldberg-Polin moved to Israel with his family when he was 7 years old.\nAs a child, he wanted to learn about the world, poring over maps and atlases to learn the names of capital cities and mountains. Later he became a fan of psychedelic trance music and once took a nine-week trek through six European countries so he could attend a series of raves.\nNot surprising then, that he and some friends headed to the Tribe of Nova music festival, billed as a place \u201cwhere the essence of unity and love combines forces with the best music.\u201d\nThat vibe was shattered by gunmen who stormed into Israel from the nearby Gaza Strip.\nWitnesses said Goldberg-Polin lost part of an arm when the attackers tossed grenades into a temporary shelter where he and others had taken refuge, but he tied a tourniquet around it and walked out before being bundled into the truck.\nFamily and friends have organized the \u201cBring Hersh Home\u201d campaign on social media, hoping he will still be able to take a planned backpack trip through southern Asia.\nBut first his mother hopes someone helps her son.\n\u201cIt will require like the biggest heroism and strength and courage, but I want someone to help out and I want someone to help all of those hostages.\u201d\n\u2014 Danica Kirka\nAda Sagi\nAda Sagi was getting ready to travel to London to celebrate her 75th birthday with family when Hamas militants attacked her kibbutz and took her hostage.\nThe trip was supposed to be a joyous occasion after a year of trauma. Her husband died of cancer last year, she had struggled with allergies and was recovering from hip replacement surgery. But the grandmother of six was getting through it, even though it was hard.\n\u201cThey had a very, very, very strong bond of 54 years,\u201d her son Noam, a psychotherapist in London, told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd my mum, this is her main thing now, really, just getting her life back after dealing with the loss of my dad.\u201d\nAda Sagi was born in Tel Aviv in 1948, the daughter of Holocaust survivors from Poland. She moved to a kibbutz at the age of 18 because she was attracted by the ideals of equality and humanity on which the communal settlements were built.\nA mother of three, Ada decided to learn Arabic so she could make friends with her neighbors and build a better future for her children. She later taught the language to other Israelis as a way to improve communication with the Palestinians who live near Kibbutz Nir Oz, on the southeastern border of the Gaza Strip.\nThat was, for many years, her mission, Noam said.\nWhile he hopes his mother\u2019s language skills will help her negotiate with the hostage-takers, he is calling on the international community for assistance.\n\u201cThe only hope I have now is ... for humanity to do something and for me to see my mother again and for my son to see his grandmother again,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we need humanity to actually flex its muscle here, and\u201d \u2014 by telling her story \u2014 \u201cthat is all I\u2019m trying to do.\u201d\n\u2014 Danica Kirka\nAdina Moshe\nDavid Moshe was born in Iraq. Decades later in Israel, his wife, Adina, cooked his favorite Iraqi food, including a traditional dish with dough, meat and rice.\nBut what really delighted the family, their granddaughter Anat recalls, was Adina\u2019s maqluba \u2014 a Middle Eastern meal served in a pot that is flipped upside-down at the table, releasing the steaming goodness inside. Pleasing her husband of more than a half-century, Anat Moshe says, was her grandmother\u2019s real culinary priority.\n\u201cThey were so in love, you don\u2019t know how in love they were,\u201d the 25-year-old said. Adina Moshe \u201cwould make him his favorite food, Iraqi food. Our Shabbat table was always so full.\u201d\nIt will be wracked with heartbreak now.\nOn Oct. 7, Hamas fighters shot and killed David Moshe, 75, as he and Adina huddled in their bomb shelter in Nir Oz, a kibbutz about 2 miles from the Gaza border. The militants burned the couple\u2019s house. The next time Anat Moshe saw her grandmother was in a video, in which Adina Moshe, 72, in a red top, was sandwiched between two insurgents on a motorbike, driving away.\nHer grandmother hasn\u2019t been heard from since, Anat Moshe said. She\u2019d had heart surgery last year, and is without her medication.\nStill, Anat Moshe brightened when she recalled her family life in Nir Oz. The community was the birthplace and landscape of Adina and David\u2019s romance and family. The two met at the pool, Anat said. Adina worked as a minder of small children, so generations of residents knew her.\nBut all along, low-level anxiety hummed about the community\u2019s proximity to Gaza.\n\u201cThere was always like some concern about it, like rumors,\u201d Anat Moshe recalled. \u201cShe always told us that when the terrorists come to her house, she will make her coffee and put out some cookies and put out great food.\u201d\n\u2014 Laurie Kellman\nMoran Stela Yanai\nDelicate pearls peek out from silver and stainless steel chains \u2014 bits of brightness and optimism among Moran Stela Yanai\u2019s jewelry designs that reflected cultures around the world.\nCreating art to wear has been Yanai\u2019s passion, but not the only one, her brother-in-law Dan Mor said. Yanai, a 40-year-old Israeli who disappeared after a desert rave, also fiercely protected people and animals.\n\u201cMoran is the softest soul,\u201d recalls Dan Mor, whose wife, Lea, is Moran\u2019s sister. \u201cShe could almost be annoying with how much she was so kind and sensitive to animals. You couldn\u2019t eat meat because she was so sensitive to animals being harmed \u2014 not just pets but farm animals and wild animals.\u201d\nThe family was horrified to recognize her in a video on TikTok that surfaced after the attack on southern Israel. In it, Yanai is sitting on the ground, looking terrified, amid derogatory Arabic text about Jews.\nDays earlier, Yanai had posted a video on Instagram on her way to the rave, where she hoped to sell her designs. She posted a second video, recorded by a friend, of her designs displayed on a table at the festival.\n\u201cMoran, kind-hearted, never caused pain to anyone, not even a fly,\u201d reads the accompanying text. Her work, Mor said, is inspired by cultures around the world, including Chinese and Arab.\nMor, an actor, said his family in Tel Aviv is feeling Moran\u2019s absence deeply and trying to fill the wait by telling the world about her.\n\u201cMy beautiful dear sister-in-law, auntie to my kids,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had a big heart, she has a big heart, and I\u2019m hoping that heart is still pumping.\u201d\n\u2014 Laurie Kellman", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "5 hostages of Hamas are free, offering some hope to families of more than 200 still captive", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-hamas-israel-israelis-family-b2439253.html"}
