More than 9,700 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza so far, two-thirds of them women and minors, Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry has said.\nThe increase in antisemitic acts in France has raised fears for the country with a Jewish population of over 500,000, the largest in Europe and the third biggest in the world after Israel and the US.\nMr Darmanin said he understood the \u201capprehension\u201d of French Jews and added that all means are being deployed to protect them.\nParis police chief Laurent Nunez said there had been 257 antisemitic incidents in Paris alone and 90 people have been arrested.\nHe said there was \u201cno typical profile\u201d of the people who were found involved in such acts.\n\u201cWe find all the profiles, young kids, who say very serious things\u201d, but also \u201cpeople more anchored in the defense of the pro-Palestinian cause and who slip up\u201d, he said.\nIn one incident that was reported on 4 November, a Jewish woman was stabbed in her home in the city of Lyon. Prosecutors investigating the attack suspect it is linked to antisemitism.\nPolice said they were treating the attack as attempted murder and no arrest has been made yet. They said the woman\u2019s life was not in danger.\nFrance last month banned all pro-Palestinian demonstrations and president Emmanuel Macron urged people not to allow the war in the Middle East to erupt into tensions at home.\nThis came after Paris police resorted to using teargas and water cannons on pro-Palestinian protesters who defied the ban and demonstrated against the Israeli government.\nMore than 13 French citizens have been killed in the ongoing fighting in Israel, with 17 people missing and several others believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "France records more than 1,000 antisemitic acts since 7 October, interior minister says", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-antisemitic-attacks-israel-hamas-war-b2442186.html"}
