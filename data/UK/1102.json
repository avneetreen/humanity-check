The critics have argued that this approach has not been effective.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an open secret for weeks that significant dissent and frustration has permeated across the US government \u2013 driven by heightening concern around the scale of Israel\u2019s military response in Gaza,\u201d Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. \u201cThe trigger for much of the internal dissent was Biden\u2019s public comments \u2013 initially his zero-sum approach to the issue and then his misinformed scepticism of casualty figures in Gaza.\u201d\nMore than 1,000 staffers at the US Agency for International Development (Usaid) signed an open letter calling on the administration to make better use of its leverage to limit the civilian death toll, and scores of state department staff have argued for a change in policy through the state department\u2019s formal dissent channel, reportedly on three occasions.\nThe secretary of state, Antony Blinken, takes the dissent seriously, his officials say. Discussions have been encouraged at foreign missions around the world soliciting feedback.\n\u201cWe\u2019re listening: What you share is informing our policy and our messages,\u201d Blinken said in a message to staff, in which he acknowledged: \u201cI know that for many of you, the suffering caused by this crisis is taking a profound personal toll.\u201d\nTom Yazdgerdi, the head of the American Foreign Service Association, the diplomats\u2019 trade union, praised the administration for its readiness to listen to internal criticism, in marked contrast to its predecessor.\n\u201cI think there was some concern, particularly by members of Arab American and Muslim American employee organizations at the state department and elsewhere that took issue with the policy, and the fact that this administration does put a premium on dissent and that these groups actually met the secretary himself, along with other leaders at the department \u2013 that was good,\u201d Yazdgerdi said in an interview.\n\u201cWe were happy to see that because those views need to be heard. They probably have had some effect, I imagine.\u201d\nUS officials say the administration\u2019s call for restraint, and emphasis on the need to limit the civilian death toll, has been conveyed repeatedly to Israel, and the Pentagon has been giving the Israel Defense Forces advice on how to target Hamas in Gaza while minimising \u201ccollateral damage\u201d.\nThe officials say that there was support within the Israeli government after 7 October for a pre-emptive attack on Hezbollah in Lebanon, to blunt the threat of a second front, before launching a ground offensive into Gaza. The fact there was no such pre-emptive strike, they say, was due in part to US persuasion, thus fending off the risk, for now, of a wider regional conflict. Hezbollah itself, US officials believe, has no interest in escalating the conflict, and is firing just enough rockets across Israel\u2019s northern border to maintain its credibility as a symbol of resistance against Israel.\nUS officials have meanwhile stiffened the tone of their remarks on Gaza. Biden said on Monday that hospitals there \u201cmust be protected\u201d.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sullivan said the US was also focused on negotiations to free hostages being held by Hamas, as many as 10 of whom are thought to be Americans who have yet to be accounted for. On Monday he met some of the hostages\u2019 family members.\nThe Usaid administrator, Samantha Power, stiffened the rhetoric further on Tuesday, saying: \u201cIsrael\u2019s restoration of communications, electricity, water lines, and fuel to Gaza is imperative.\n\u201cAnd even as Israel defends its people, it is imperative that the IDF adhere to international humanitarian law,\u201d Power told a meeting of an advisory board created to fund Israeli-Palestinian partnerships.\nUS officials pointed out that the tougher tone was in response to events on the ground, as well as US internal dissent. Senior diplomats argue that the high level of vocal dissent is in part a generational phenomenon, and that the current crop of young foreign service officers feels more entitled to have a say over policy than their predecessors.\nThey also point out that such levels of dissent are not unprecedented. The state department was in constant turmoil during the Trump administration, especially over its early efforts to establish a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d on immigrants. There were three high-level state department resignations over the Iraq war, but there has only been one so far over the Gaza war: Josh Paul, from the political-military bureau.\nAdministration officials also point to the limits to outrage in the Arab world. Neither Bahrain nor the United Arab Emirates has renounced their Abraham accords normalisation agreements with Israel, and Saudi Arabia has insisted it is still interested in pursuing one of its own.\nLister said that the adjustment in US administration tone had in part been a result of Biden\u2019s own initial instincts being reined in by his own officials.\n\u201cWith time, it became increasingly clear that Biden himself was the sole driver of that initial zero-sum approach and it took weeks of concerted high-level effort \u2013 from state, Usaid, the intelligence community and even part of the national security council itself \u2013 to turn things around and shape a more holistic, strategic approach that prioritised support to Israel alongside a far greater emphasis on civilian protection, humanitarian access, and commitment to international humanitarian law and the laws of war.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "White House seeks to restrain Israel in Gaza amid growing internal dissent", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/14/biden-letter-israel-gaza-war-ceasefire"}
