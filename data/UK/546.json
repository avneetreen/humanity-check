She first won election to the Nassau County legislature in 2021 and won re-election last month.\nGeorge Santos leaves the US Capitol after being expelled on 1 December (Getty Images)\nDespite running as a Republican, Ms Pilip is a registered Democrat, according to The New York Times.\nMeanwhile, Suzan DelBene, who chairs House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, described Ms Pilip as \u201cserial fraudster George Santos\u2019 close friend\u201d and a \u201cMAGA extremist.\u201d\n\u201cThe people of NY-03 have made it clear that they want honest, responsible representation from a steady hand and a trusted leader, yet New York Republicans selected Mazi Melesa Pilip \u2014 who recently campaigned with MAGA extremist Mike Johnson and previously endorsed serial fraudster George Santos,\u201d House Majority PAC New York press secretary Alisha Heng added.\nNassau County legislator Mazi Melesa Pilip (John Lamparski/Sipa USA/AP)\nThe special election comes after Mr Santos, who is currently facing a 23-count federal indictment, was expelled from Congress earlier this month after the House Ethics Committee released a report which outlined \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that the former congressman had violated federal law.\nIn the report, Mr Santos was accused of lying about loaning personal money to his 2022 congressional campaign, then \u201cpaying himself back\u201d for the fake loans using campaign funds.\nHe also used donor money to splash out on personal indulgences such as Botox, Hermes merchandise, vacations to the Hamptons and Las Vegas, and on OnlyFans, the committee found.\nHe has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him.\nThe race to replace him is set to be close given the Republicans\u2019 small majority in the House. President Joe Biden previously carried the district by eight percentage points in 2020, according to calculations from Daily Kos Elections. Mr Santos won the district two years later, also by an eight-point margin.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Who is the proposed replacement for George Santos?", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/george-santos-replacement-b2464732.html"}
