Since the start of the war, at least 63 journalists and media workers in Gaza have been killed, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\nSome international journalists have embedded with the IDF inside Gaza since 7 October. However, the IDF has forbidden contact with Palestinians on the ground and has insisted that reports be submitted for review before publication or broadcast.\nThe risk of death or injury means that many international media organisations would be reluctant to send staff into Gaza while fighting was continuing even if access was possible.\n\u201cThe FPA is aware of the unique security challenges posed by the current war. Nonetheless, Israel has always enabled access to Gaza during and after previous rounds of fighting. It also is legally obligated, under a previous supreme court ruling,\u201d the FPA said in a statement.\n\u201cThe FPA expects the Israeli government and the IDF to stand true to their commitments to allow freedom of reporting for journalists and allow access beyond the limited number of controlled embedment opportunities the army has offered.\u201d\nThe Israeli government press office, which has issued media credentials to about 2,800 international journalists since 7 October, said the Erez crossing had been \u201cfully operational\u201d up until the Hamas attack.\n\u201cSince then nobody has crossed it \u2013 not Palestinian workers, not diplomats, not NGOs and not journalists. The only active land crossing for people into Gaza is Rafah, which is under exclusive Egyptian control,\u201d said Ron Paz, head of the foreign press department.\nAny decision about allowing journalists access was a \u201cmatter of policy which is beyond my realm at the government press office,\u201d he added.\nJeremy Bowen, the BBC\u2019s international editor who has covered the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades, said: \u201cNot being on the scene makes reporting much harder. In war reporting, nothing beats using your own eyes and ears.\u201d\nPalestinian journalists in Gaza have also found it frustrating \u201cbecause movement is very difficult and dangerous\u201d.\nBowen said he would \u201cprobably go into Gaza\u201d if access was permitted. \u201cBut it would be with a sense of trepidation.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI doubt Israel will let journalists in until some time after a ceasefire. Both sides want to control the media battlefield, but Israel is in a better position to do so because they control access to Gaza \u2013 and the Hamas leadership is under attack and in hiding.\n\u201cWhat has really changed things is the proliferation of videos people post online. Closing down a story completely is impossible these days.\u201d\nSecunder Kermani, foreign correspondent for Channel 4 News, who has been covering the war since its start, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hugely frustrating not to be able to document first-hand the awful scenes in Gaza. Of course there are many Palestinian journalists doing crucial and dangerous work, either producing powerful reports themselves or providing us with material.\n\u201cEverything in this war is so contested, being able to access Gaza independently would allow us to delve more deeply into the many competing claims and counter-claims, as well to get a better understanding of the internal dynamics within Gaza right now.\n\u201cThe ramifications of this war will be felt for many years and in many places across the world. It\u2019s essential international journalists are able to scrutinise it.\u201d\nAnother senior international journalist who asked not to be named said the difficulties of information-gathering were getting worse \u201cbecause the phone networks were now down most of the time\u201d.\nBut, the journalist added, \u201cthe idea that if the borders opened, everyone would charge in \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true, given the issues of safety\u201d.\nIn other conflicts, it was possible to retreat from the frontline but in Gaza nowhere was safe. Reporting this war was \u201cone of the biggest journalistic challenges any of us has faced\u201d.\nJamie Wilson, head of international news at the Guardian, said: \u201cThis is a difficult issue for media organisations. We want to provide comprehensive reporting on the ground, but the situation in Gaza is extremely dangerous.\n\u201cNevertheless, this is a decision that news organisations should be weighing up for themselves, rather than having the Israeli government denying access to international journalists.\u201d\nIn the 2008-9 war in Gaza, which lasted three weeks, Israel denied access to the territory to international journalists until a ceasefire was declared. In later conflicts in 2012 and 2014, media workers were allowed entry via the Erez crossing.\nIsraeli journalists have been banned from entering Gaza since Hamas won elections in 2006.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018Hugely frustrating\u2019: international media seek to overcome Gaza ban", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/12/hugely-frustrating-international-media-seek-to-overcome-gaza-ban"}
