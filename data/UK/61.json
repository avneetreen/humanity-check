In a statement from St\u00e9phane Dujarric, the UN chief\u2019s spokesperson, Guterres noted that decisions of the ICJ are binding and that he \u201ctrusts that all parties will duly comply with the Order from the Court.\u201d In a separate statement, the UN chief said he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the \u201cserious\u201d allegations implicating several staff members at the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October. Guterres has asked UNRWA commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, to investigate the allegations and to ensure that any employee shown to have participated or abetted in the attacks be \u201cterminated immediately and referred for potential criminal prosecution. \u201c\n26 Jan 2024 23.45 CET Nasser hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza has experienced a complete power outage, according to reports. The hospital, one of only two in the southern half of Gaza that can still treat critically ill patients, is completely without power, Al Jazeera is reporting.\n26 Jan 2024 23.24 CET Gaza no longer has a healthcare system, warns MSF Vital medical services at Gaza\u2019s largest functioning health facility have collapsed amid ongoing intense fighting and bombing in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, leaving people with no options to go for treatment, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) has warned. Most of the staff at Nasser hospital, along with thousands of displaced people sheltering in the hospital, fled in the days leading up to the evacuation order by Israel Defense Forces (IDF), MSF said in a statement today. It said the hospital\u2019s surgical capacity is \u201calmost nonexistent\u201d while the \u201chandful\u201d of medical staff who remain must contend with \u201cvery low supplies that are insufficient to handle mass casualty events\u201d. Between 300 and 350 patients remain at Nasser hospital, it said, noting that they were unable to evacuate because \u201cit is too dangerous and there are no ambulances\u201d. It said at least one patient had died on Wednesday because there was no orthopaedic surgeon available. Meanwhile, the European Gaza hospital, the second biggest facility in southern Gaza, is \u201cunreachable\u201d for medical staff and people because its neighbouring areas are under evacuation order, it said. Guillemette Thomas, MSF medical coordinator in Palestine, said: People\u2019s lives are at risk because of the lack of medical care. With Nasser and European Gaza Hospital almost inaccessible, there is no longer a healthcare system in Gaza.\nUpdated at 23.37 CET\n26 Jan 2024 23.05 CET Chinese officials have asked their Iranian counterparts to help rein in attacks on ships in the Red Sea by the Iran-backed Houthis, or else risk harming business relations with Beijing, according to a report. An Iranian official briefed on the talks between Beijing and Tehran told Reuters: Basically, China says: \u2018If our interests are harmed in any way, it will impact our business with Tehran. So tell the Houthis to show restraint\u2019. The Chinese officials did not make any specific comments or threats about how Beijing\u2019s trading relationship with Iran could be affected if its interests were damaged by Houthi attacks, Iranian sources told the news agency. The Houthi attacks, which the group say are in support of Palestinians in Gaza, have raised the cost of shipping and insurance by disrupting a key trade route between Asia and Europe used widely by ships from China. Beijing had made it clear it would be disappointed with Tehran if any vessels linked to China were hit, or if its interests were affected in any way, the sources said. But while China was important to Iran, Tehran also had proxies in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, besides the Houthis in Yemen, and its regional alliances and priorities played a major role in its decision making, one of the Iranian sources said.\n26 Jan 2024 22.52 CET IDF says 'intensive' battles continue in Khan Younis The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said \u201cintensive battles\u201d continued to rage in the heart of the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, as it said dozens of Hamas targets were destroyed. In an update this morning, the IDF said it had discovered about 200 tunnel shafts in Khan Younis and more than 130 Hamas military infrastructures. Among the targets hit by Israeli fighter jets on Friday morning were \u201cterror targets\u201d that included operational centres, weapons storage facilities, observation posts, and meeting points used by Hamas militants, it said. Residents of Khan Younis reported gun battles raging overnight, with Israeli forces blowing up buildings and houses in the western part of the city. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society reported on Thursday that Israeli units had bombed and shelled the area around the al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis, and that rescue workers could no longer reach it. Most of the Gaza Strip\u2019s 2.3m population have been forced to squeeze into Khan Younis and its nearby towns, after being driven out of northern Gaza earlier in Israel\u2019s military campaign.\n26 Jan 2024 22.33 CET Patrick Wintour In seeking a provisional order from the international court of justice restraining Israel from committing potentially genocidal acts in Gaza, South Africa put not just Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians in the dock but also the whole post-second world war rules-based order, including the authority of the ICJ itself. Never has there been such a high-profile case brought in the middle of such a bloody conflict, and rarely have so many staked so much on the outcome. In the words of the Irish barrister Blinne N\u00ed Ghr\u00e1laigh, who set out part of South\u2019s Africa case to the court, \u201cthe imminent risk of death, harm and destruction that Palestinians in Gaza face today, and that they risk every day during the pendency of these proceedings, on any view justifies \u2013 indeed compels \u2013 the indication of provisional measures. Some might say that the very reputation of international law \u2013 its ability and willingness to bind and to protect all peoples equally \u2013 hangs in the balance. Extraordinarily, the court did not shirk from what it regarded as its responsibilities. It did not order a full ceasefire but it granted protective orders, including an end to the killing of Palestinians in Gaza, that went further than many international law experts were predicting. The ruling is devastating for Israel and awkward for politicians such as the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who said the case was meritless, and the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, who urged South Africa not to bandy around words such as genocide. The highest court in the world, the apex of the United Nations, has found there is a plausible risk that Palestinians\u2019 right to be protected from a genocide are under threat from Israel\u2019s actions. The irony of this is self-evident. The concepts of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d and \u201cgenocide\u201d were created by a Jewish law professor, Raphael Lemkin. For Israel, a nation in part born in 1948 from the horrors of the Holocaust and centuries of persecution, this could be a moment for reflection. Its whole national identity is intertwined with the Holocaust, just as South\u2019s Africa\u2019s is indivisible from apartheid.

Milei, in a speech during a Holocaust remembrance event in Buenos Aires, said he would travel to Israel \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d, one of his first overseas trips since he took office last month. He said: In the coming weeks I will be traveling to the Holy Land in what will constitute a new chapter in the brotherhood between our two nations. Argentina would \u201cnot remain silent in the face of Hamas terror\u201d, he said, as he condemned the \u201catrocious and unforgivable\u201d attacks by Hamas on Israel on 7 October. Eleven Argentines are among the civilian hostages held by Hamas, he said. Argentina\u2019s Jewish community is one of the largest in Latin America and before taking office in December, Milei said he intended to convert to Judaism.

In a statement, Oxfam urged the UK government to \u201crespect the court ruling, and cease its complicity in the crisis, starting by immediately stopping arms sales to Israel given the risk of them being used to commit war crimes and calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.\u201d \u201cAnything less will be a stain on the UK\u2019s reputation as an upholder of international law,\u201d it said. The statement continues: Palestinians should not have to endure another day of this suffering. We urge the UK and all countries to do all in their power to ensure those responsible for violations on both sides are held accountable, to secure the release of all hostages and detainees, and to end Israel\u2019s decades-long occupation of Palestinian territory.\n26 Jan 2024 21.34 CET Joe Biden spoke on Friday with his Egyptian and Qatari counterparts ahead of a trip to Europe by CIA director William Burns to seek a deal to secure the release of more hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, the Associated Press reports. National security council spokesperson John Kirby told a White House press briefing that Biden spoke with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Qatar\u2019s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani. He added that while talks have been constructive, \u201cwe should not expect any imminent developments,\u201d adding: We continue to do everything we can to facilitate another hostage deal, just as we did in November. CIA Director Burns is slated to soon meet in Europe with David Barnea, the head of Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence agency, Qatari prime minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel, according to three people familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks. The meeting will focus on the release of hostages in exchange for a pause in hostilities. The Biden administration\u2019s hope is that an agreement could lead to an extended ceasefire that could eventually bring an end to the conflict, according to a US. official. The CIA and the White House national security council declined to comment on the meeting. Burns\u2019 trip comes after a visit to the Mideast by White House senior envoy Brett McGurk this week focused on winning the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. McGurk has also been laying the groundwork for another trip to the region by the US secretary of state Antony Blinken, who next week could make his fifth trip to the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October.\n26 Jan 2024 21.21 CET Vessel on fire after Houthi missile attack in Gulf of Aden, says firm The Singapore-based commodities company Trafigura has confirmed one of its vessels is on fire in the Gulf of Aden following a missile strike by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.

It added military help was on the way: Firefighting equipment on board is being deployed to suppress and control the fire caused in one cargo tank on the starboard side. We remain in contact with the vessel and are monitoring the situation carefully. Military ships in the region are underway to provide assistance.\nUpdated at 22.00 CET\n26 Jan 2024 20.59 CET Britain\u2019s opposition Labour party is urging Israel to comply fully with the orders of the International Court of Justice\u2019s ruling on the war in Gaza. The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, called for an \u201cend to extremist rhetoric\u201d and Israel\u2019s adherence to the \u201curgent provisional measures\u201d set out in the interim decision, the UK Press Association reported. View image in fullscreen David Lammy. Photograph: Maja Smiejkowska/PA The International Court of Justice (ICJ) stopped short of ordering a ceasefire in Gaza but demanded Israel attempted to try to contain death and damage in its military offensive. Lammy said: The interim ruling under the Genocide Convention on the situation in Gaza is a profoundly serious moment. Labour has been clear throughout the conflict that international law must be upheld, that the independence of international courts must be respected, and that all sides must be accountable for their actions. The ICJ\u2019s interim ruling\u2026 sets out urgent provisional measures that must be followed. Israel must now comply with the orders in this ruling in full. The ICJ\u2019s measures align closely with Labour\u2019s longstanding calls for the protection of civilians, urgent humanitarian relief in Gaza and an end to extremist rhetoric. We will press for these orders to be implemented, alongside an immediate humanitarian truce and a sustainable ceasefire. David Cameron, the UK foreign secretary, was concluding a visit to the Middle East on Friday, having pushed the Israeli government on a two-state solution to the Middle East crisis and called for urgent humanitarian pauses in Israel\u2019s military operations.\n26 Jan 2024 20.41 CET Houthis claim attack on 'British oil tanker' Yemen\u2019s Houthi militants say their naval forces carried out an operation targeting a vessel they identified as \u201cthe British oil tanker Marlin Luanda\u201d in the Gulf of Aden on Friday, Reuters is reporting.
