Washington instead supports pauses in fighting to protect civilians and allow the release of hostages taken by Hamas.\nDiplomats said that Washington is also unhappy with a proposal in the UAE draft resolution that asks UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres to establish a monitoring mechanism in Gaza \"to exclusively monitor all humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza provided through land, sea and air routes of those states that are not parties to the conflict\".\nPalestinian ambassador to the United Nations Riyad Mansour listens to members of the UN Security Council as they break during a meeting on the Israel-Hamas war at the United Nations headquarters on 19 December 2023 in New York City (Getty Images)\nLimited humanitarian aid and fuel deliveries have crossed into Gaza via the Rafah crossing from Egypt, subjected to monitoring by Israel, but UN officials and aid workers say it comes nowhere near to satisfying the most basic needs of Gazans.\nNate Evans, spokesperson for the US mission to the UN, said on Tuesday: \"We believe there needs to be a large increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza, as we have worked to achieve on the ground through our diplomacy. We continue to work constructively with council members on this product.\"\nThe US on 8 December vetoed a Security Council resolution backed by almost all other council members and dozens of other nations demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza. The 193-member General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a similar resolution on 12 December by a vote of 153-10, with 23 abstentions.\nIn its first unified action on 15 November, with the US abstaining, the Security Council adopted a resolution calling for \u201curgent and extended humanitarian pauses\u201d in the fighting, unhindered aid deliveries to civilians and the unconditional release of all hostages.\nIsraeli president Isaac Herzog said during a briefing with ambassadors that Israel is \u201cready for another humanitarian pause and additional humanitarian aid in order to enable the release of hostages.\u201d\nA person holds up a sign during a Pro-Palestine march to participate in a Global Strike for Gaza on 18 December 2023 in New York City, New York (Getty Images)\nSecurity Council resolutions are important because they are legally binding, but in practice many parties choose to ignore the council\u2019s requests for action. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they are a significant barometer of world opinion.\nNearly 20,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry since Israel declared war on Hamas following its surprise attacks in southern Israel on 7 October. The Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people \u2014 mostly civilians \u2014 and took about 240 hostages back to Gaza.\nHamas controls the Gaza Strip, and its Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. Thousands more Palestinians lie buried under the rubble of Gaza, the UN estimates.\nThe conflict has spread beyond Gaza, including into the Red Sea where Iran-aligned Houthi forces based in Yemen have been attacking commercial vessels with missiles and drones, prompting the creation of a multinational naval operation to protect trade routes.\nUS defense secretary Lloyd Austin said in Bahrain that joint naval patrols would be held in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, which encompass a major East-West global shipping route.\n\"This is an international challenge that demands collective action,\" Mr Austin said.\nAdditional reporting from the agencies", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "UN Security Council delays Gaza ceasefire vote in bid to avoid US veto", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/unsc-vote-us-gaza-ceasefire-israel-hamas-b2467002.html"}
