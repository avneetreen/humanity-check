Mummy, I think I\u2019m going to die,\u201d were some of the last words Romi Gonen, 23, said to her mother, Meirav Leshem Gonen, after Hamas stormed southern Israeli towns and kibbutzim on 7 October.\nLeshem Gonen, 54, could hear shooting during the frantic 40-minute phone call but tried to comfort her daughter, who was at the Supernova music festival, saying: \u201cEverything will be OK\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better. You are not alone, you are with me, my darling.\u201d\nThe call, the last 25 minutes of which the family recorded, was cut off at 10.59am. Romi is thought to be one of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas on what some in Israel now refer to as \u201cBlack Saturday\u201d.\nView image in fullscreen Romi Gonen, 23, was among those captured by Hamas militants at the Supernova music festival in southern Israel. Photograph: Meirav Leshem Gonen\nHer mother and the relatives of other hostages arrived outside Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office in Jerusalem on Saturday at the end of a five-day, 40-mile march from Tel Aviv to demand the release of their loved ones.\nThe families and thousands of their supporters reached the prime minister\u2019s office in the afternoon and chanted the Hebrew word achshav, meaning \u201cnow\u201d.\n\u201cWe want the government to come and talk to us. It\u2019s been 43 days,\u201d said Leshem Gonen. \u201cBefore taking any decision we want them to look in our eyes to make sure they remember who we are.\n\u201cRomi is a wonderful and energetic and loving person. She\u2019s a young girl who has just started her life and we want her back \u2013 her and all the others, more than 200 who were kidnapped. This is the only agenda.\u201d\nYarden Gonen, 30, Romi\u2019s sister, said the families feel neglected by the government. \u201cBut we have the power to unite every civilian in Israel and all the people that feel like we are their own family,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe want to show the Israeli government and the world that everyone is with us, that all the civilians in Israel are with us.\n00:00:54 Families of Israeli hostages reach Jerusalem after five-day march \u2013 video\n\u201cThe government in Israel and the world should see it, should know it, that we have the power of the people and we\u2019re not going to back down until the hostages are home.\u201d\nMany blame their government for being blindsided by the Hamas attacks, and relatives and friends of the missing fear they will come to harm in the Israeli military\u2019s assault on Gaza. Hamas has claimed that some of the hostages have been killed in the invasion by Israeli forces.\nThe marchers left Tel Aviv on Tuesday, clutching water bottles and sleeping bags as they prepared to camp each night along the way. More than 3,000 volunteers provided food and set up tents for the group.\nOn Friday, Miki Zohar, a member of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, showed up but was largely met by jeers, with the crowd yelling \u201cShame!\u201d and \u201cTake responsibility!\u201d Yair Lapid, Israel\u2019s opposition leader, also joined the march on Saturday.\nAs thousands of people joined the rally outside Netanyahu\u2019s office, Yuval Haran, who has seven relatives who were taken hostage, told the crowd: \u201cWe ask a simple thing \u2013 come and talk to us.\u201d\nHaran\u2019s father, Avshalom, 66, and his aunt Lilach Kipnis and uncle Eviatar Kipnis were killed after Hamas stormed the Be\u2019eri kibbutz.\nHis mother, Shoshan, 67, and his sister, Adi Shoham, along with her husband, Tal, their son, Naveh, eight, and daughter Yahel, three, were abducted. His aunt and her 12-year-old daughter were also kidnapped. Haran added: \u201cWe have to bring them back today, we can\u2019t lose any more people.\u201d\nYarden said the families were \u201cdone waiting\u201d as she described the last 10 minutes of her mother\u2019s phone call with Romi, a waitress who loved travelling. She said her sister had stopped talking and was instead crying quietly. \u201cIn the last 10 minutes you can hear the terrorists on her head, screaming,\u201d Yarden said.\nShe added: \u201cWe got someone who speaks Arabic and we asked him to translate what they\u2019re saying. They\u2019re saying that she\u2019s alive, and one of them is asking the other not to shoot her and to keep her alive.\nView image in fullscreen Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza march to Knesset in Jerusalem demanding the release of their relatives. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\u201cThen they\u2019re debating whether to take her or leave her and one of them said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to take her,\u2019 and the other said: \u2018No, no, you should take her.\u2019 He replied: \u2018OK, OK. I\u2019ll take her with me,\u2019 and then they hung up the phone.\u201d\nAt 2:32pm that day, the family tracked the location of Romi\u2019s mobile phone to Gaza. Since then, the family has been in agony, Yarden said\nIsraeli and Arabic news outlets have reported on negotiations to secure the release of at least some of the hostages, but there has been no confirmation from either side of an imminent deal.\nWhile Netanyahu initially refused to meet the families, Benny Gantz, a former defence minister who sits in Israel\u2019s war cabinet, signalled he would be willing to. So once the rally outside Netanyahu\u2019s office came to an end, the families headed back to Tel Aviv for a meeting with Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, a former Israel Defense Forces chief.\nBy late on Saturday evening, Netanyahu had appeared to bow to pressure by agreeing to a meeting on Monday with the families.\n\u201cWe need to see that they\u2019re doing everything in their power to get the hostages back home,\u201d Yarden said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not going to back down. This march ends today, but we\u2019re not going to back down if they\u2019re not here. We\u2019re here, until they\u2019re here.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018Just look us in the eye\u2019: Israeli hostages\u2019 families arrive at Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Jerusalem office", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/18/just-look-us-in-the-eye-israeli-hostages-families-arrive-at-benjamin-netanyahus-jerusalem-office"}
