He later joined forces with renowned gang leader Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier, known as Barbecue, who formed the \u201cG9 Family and Allies\u201d alliance, Haiti\u2019s biggest and most powerful gang group.\nMedia interviews granted by Ch\u00e9rizier first had to be approved by Andrice.\nThe U.N. said that Andrice, like other gang leaders, created a social foundation in 2015 known as the Silo\u00e9 Foundation to win over the community he controlled and present a positive image of himself.\nAndrice and other gang leaders were accused of leading several deadly raids on Haitian neighborhoods that targeted civilians, according to a report by the nonprofit National Human Rights Defense Network in Haiti.\nThey also were accused of paralyzing operations at a main fuel terminal in the capital, Port-au-Prince, last year, crippling the country and forcing Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry to make his first request for the urgent deployment of a foreign armed force.\n___\nAssociated Press reporter D\u00e1nica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Math teacher who became powerful Haitian gang leader has been killed, former mayor says", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-portauprince-barbecue-san-juan-puerto-rico-b2446623.html"}
