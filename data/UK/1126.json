He said they were probably using the network to store weapons. 'That is a war crime.'\nPalestinians injured in Israeli raids arrive at Nasser Medical Hospital on November 14, 2023 on November 13, 2023 in Khan Yunis, Gaza. The White House says Hamas uses tunnels beneath hospitals for its military\nIsraeli forces have continued to pound Gaza for weeks\nIsrael has long accused Hamas of hiding its forces among civilian targets. Hamas officials have said more than 10,000 have died in Israel's campaign, although the White House says it cannot verify the figure.\nAn estimated 1,400 were killed in the Hamas October 7 attack on Israel.\nKirby said the Palestinian groups were prepared to respond to Israeli military operations, with IDF ground forces nearby.\nKirby was non-specific about the intelligence methods that provided the information.\nHe said it was based on 'a variety of intelligence methods of our own' \u2013 distinguishing it from information from the Israelis.\n'I think you can understand that we're not going to be able to provide a whole lot of granular detail on that, we have to protect sources and methods. But we were able to downgrade some information to be able to provide that for you today but it comes from a variety of intelligence methods of our own, of our own,' he said.\nOn his trip to Israel immediately after the attacks, President Biden backed up Israeli's government after it said an errant missile launched by Palestinian Islamic Jihad was responsible for the explosion at a different hospital in Gaza.\nBiden said it 'it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you,' in remarks to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nKirby laid down some markers for what the government considers acceptable as Israel seeks to dislodge fighters and free 240 hostages seized during the Hamas raid.\n'To be clear, we do not support striking a hospital from the air. We do not want to see a firefight in a hospital where innocent people, helpless people, sick people are simply trying to get the medical care they deserve,' Kirby said.\n'We have been clear on multiple occasions - Hamas actions do not lessen Israel's responsibilities to protect civilians in Gaza, and this is something we're going to continue to have an active conversation with our counterparts about.'\nHis news update came as Biden prepares to try to focus on economic issues as he meets with Asia Pacific leaders, while also planning a high stakes sit-down with China's President Xi Jinping.\nThe Middle East conflict is expected to be a major topic on the sidelines of the conference.\nThe developments came on a day President Biden spoke optimistically about an emerging deal to free hostages in Gaza.\n'I believe it is going to happen but I don't want to get into details,' he said at the White House before going on his trip.\nThe Washington Post reported on a possible deal to free women and children held hostage in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons.\nIsrael wants all 100 women and children released, although Hamas indicated it only wanted to release 70, according to reports.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "White House says Hamas and Islamic Jihad DID hide under hospitals in Gaza, backing up Israeli claims", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12749347/White-House-says-Hamas-Islamic-Jihad-DID-hide-hospitals-Gaza-backing-Israeli-claims.html"}
