This decision is final. We will not compromise on it,\u201d said deputy Hamas chief Saleh al-Arouri.\nThe prospect of a military offensive in the south has spread terror in Gaza, where four in five people have already fled their homes for crowded shelters, schools, tents and hospital corridors.\nAfter the end of a week-long ceasefire, the area is under intensifying bombardment. As many as 1.5 million civilians face a second displacement from places that Israel initially said would be safe and into an even smaller portion of Gaza.\nEven Israel\u2019s closest ally, the US, has warned that it must do more to protect civilians as it pursues Hamas in the latest round of fighting. US vice-president Kamala Harris, speaking on the sidelines of the Cop28 summit, said Israel had a right to defend itself but not at any cost.\n\u201cAs Israel defends itself, it matters how,\u201d she said. \u201cThe US is unequivocal: international humanitarian law must be respected. Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.\u201d\nIn Britain, opposition leader Keir Starmer also warned Israel against waging a war in southern Gaza that was as bloody as its campaign in the north. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to the way the first phase of this war was conducted,\u201d he said. \u201cToo many people, innocent individuals, have lost their lives in Israel and across Gaza \u2026 We have to see this as a different stage.\u201d\nThe Israeli military offensive has killed about 15,200 people, including at least 6,000 children and 4,000 women, according to the Hamas-run authorities in Gaza. In the first 36 hours since the ceasefire broke down, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed, they said.\nView image in fullscreen Israeli bombardment of the northern Gaza Strip on Saturday. Photograph: L\u00e9o Corr\u00eaa/AP\nUnder US pressure over civilian deaths, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) sees an all-out push to assassinate the Hamas leadership as its best hope of reaching its goals \u2013 collapsing the militant organisation, forcing the return of Israeli hostages on acceptable terms and ending the war on a timescale agreeable to Washington.\n\u201cWe are under American pressure that is getting tougher. The American demand is get rid of Hamas but stop killing so many civilians,\u201d said Yossi Alpher, an analyst and former Mossad official. \u201cYou can\u2019t dismantle the infrastructure without killing a lot of people but maybe you can attack the leadership and dismantle [Hamas] that way without killing a lot of people.\u201d\nThe Israeli government proclaimed Sinwar its top target in the wake of the 7 October attacks that triggered the war, when Hamas killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. But in the first stage of fighting inside Gaza, troops mostly seized territory and degraded infrastructure. Israeli military officials have previously admitted to the Observer that, though Israel has killed significant numbers of mid-ranking battlefield commanders, it has not managed to reach any senior leaders.\nView image in fullscreen People mourning their relatives killed by the Israeli bombardment in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, on Saturday. Photograph: Fatima Shbair/AP\nSinwar and other high-ranking leaders run the movement from a vast network of tunnels under Gaza and the Israeli military now believes they may be sheltering beneath the city of Khan Younis, a focus of attacks since the truce broke down.\nMore than 50 missiles hit targets in and around the city on Saturday, while at least nine people, including three children, were killed in a strike on a house in Deir al-Balah city, also in the south, according to the hospital where the bodies were taken.\nThere were also strikes in the north, where casualties included a prominent academic, Sufyan Tayeh, president of the Islamic University of Gaza and a leading researcher in physics and applied mathematics. He was killed with his family, Reuters reported.\nA military spokesman said on Saturday afternoon that the IDF was focused on Hamas \u201ccentres of gravity\u201d distributed throughout the Gaza Strip.\n\u201cThe IDF have learned lessons. The aim will be to bring the war much closer to the leaders in order to have better a deal with regard to the release of the hostages,\u201d said Kobi Michael, an expert at the Institute for International Security Studies in Tel Aviv. Any information is likely to be fed into an AI-based system called Habsora (the Gospel) to \u201cproduce targets at a fast pace\u201d.\nMany experts are sceptical of assertions that AI-based systems reduced civilian harm by encouraging more accurate targeting, pointing to widespread destruction of entire neighbourhoods and the death toll in Gaza.\nLast night the UK said it was increasing efforts to locate hostages in Gaza. The Ministry of Defence will conduct surveillance flights over the eastern Mediterranean. The aircraft will be unarmed and only information relating to hostage rescue will be passed to the relevant authorities.\nBoth Israel\u2019s allies and critics have warned that it has not drawn up plans for Gaza\u2019s future when the war is over, when the reconstruction and governing of the devastated enclave will pose a huge challenge; the UN says 60% of the housing stock has been damaged or destroyed. Concerns are likely to be heightened by Israeli plans to carve out a buffer zone on the Palestinian side of Gaza\u2018s border to prevent future attacks, which Reuters reported had been shared with regional powers, and were confirmed by a key aide to Netanyahu. The prospect of putting part of the already small enclave off limits is likely to fuel anger in Gaza and beyond.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel using captured Hamas prisoners to track down top leaders", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/02/israel-using-hamas-prisoners-to-track-down-terror-chiefs"}
