They dispersed in the afternoon when air defense systems burst into action to fend off a missile attack.\nProtestors chanted, \u201cIt\u2019s better to buy drones than build a new park\u201d and, \u201cThe more money we spend on the army, the faster Ukraine will win this war.\u201d\n\u201cAt a time when our friends, parents and acquaintances are dying at the front, we have more pressing matters than rebuilding roads and beautifying parks,\u201d Kateryna Zaderey, one of the protesters, told The Associated Press.\nStreet protests in Ukraine were rare after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, which brought regular bombardment of the capital. Recently, though, demonstrations have gathered momentum, and Thursday\u2019s protest was the largest so far over municipal spending.\nMunicipal graft was regarded as a deep problem in Kyiv before the war. Corruption allegations have dogged Ukraine as it has received billions of dollars of Western support for its war effort. The issue has also been a hurdle for Ukraine\u2019s ambition to join the European Union, which was holding a summit to discuss providing Ukraine with 50 billion euros ($54 billion) in budget assistance and the country's prospects of EU membership.\nIn June, there was a wave of public outrage after three people died in a missile attack on Kyiv. They had been unable to enter a hospital bomb shelter that turned out to be locked.\nThe incident drew public attention to the state of the city\u2019s bomb shelters and sparked criticism of Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko.\nA subsequent investigation by Kyiv prosecutors found multiple violations in how 1.2 billion hryvnias ($32.5 million) from the city budget for the repair and maintenance of bomb shelters in 2022-2023 was actually spent.\nAmong the surprising ways money was spent on making bomb shelters comfortable were the purchases of 306 leather drums for \u201cpsychological relief of children during air raids,\u201d which cost the city almost a million UAH ($27,000), a professional electric fryer stand for 720,000 UAH ($19,500), and 12 vegetable-cutters totaling 1.6 million UAH ($43,300).\nRecent protests have focused on city maintenance and infrastructure projects worth millions of dollars that demonstrators said should have been spent on the Ukrainian military.\nDuring Thursday\u2019s protest, Klitschko told a city council meeting that Kyiv will spend an additional 600 million UAH ($16.2 million) on the needs of the military in addition to the 7 billion UAH ($190 million) that was already spent on the military's needs in 2023.\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Kyiv protesters demand more spending on the Ukraine's war effort and less on local projects", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/money-ap-ukraine-kyiv-russia-b2464134.html"}
