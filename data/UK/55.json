In the chaos, Hala's four-year-old grandson went missing.\nThe sickening act was caught on camera in a video published earlier this month on the Middle East Eye.

Sara spoke to CNN, telling how her kind and caring mother had spent the morning feeding 20 neighbours who had sought shelter in their home, cooking breakfast and taking time to pray for their safety.\nSara, now in Istanbul after joining her Turkish fiancee, said: \"My mother was going to be 58 years old on December 30, and had her grandson with her. So why would you shoot her? What\u2019s between you and her? You made us feel like it\u2019s safe to leave, we had white flags in our hands as instructed. Nobody knows.

I didn\u2019t do anything without consulting her or taking her opinion, she was with me in every step. We all had plans, dreams, goals and it all included my mother. They stole our mom from us, all these dreams are now gone. I felt like I was in a nightmare, until now I feel like I am still in denial from the whole thing, I am still waiting for my mom to send a message in the group chat to check on us.\"\nThe incident is said to be one of a number of reported killings of people carrying white flags being shot in cold blood in Gaza. CNN reported they had made attempts to share their findings with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), who responded by saying \u201cthe incident is being examined\" - however it is believed their comment was not referring to Hala's death.\nThe family later buried Hala outside their house, in a small sandy alleyway. They hope to go back to be able to give her a proper burial when the war is over and are calling for an investigation into her killing.", "source_domain": "www.mirror.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Grandmother fleeing Israeli bombs with grandson carrying white flag shot dead in street", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/grandmother-fleeing-israeli-bombs-grandson-31980381"}
