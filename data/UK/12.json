Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel and Israel\u2019s subsequent bombing and invasion of Gaza have heightened those calls.\nAdvertisement\nSenior US officials have condemned Israeli talk of \u201cmass displacement\u201d of Gazans and the \u201cresettlement\u201d of Gaza, but Vice President Kamala Harris, pressed by Katie Couric recently, refused to say that the United States would withhold aid to Israel if such policies were pursued.\n\u201cWe are troubled by statements from the conference in Jerusalem yesterday encouraging resettlement in Gaza, which was endorsed and attended by members of the Government of Israel. The US does not support an Israeli reoccupation of Gaza,\u201d a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said Monday of the conference.\n\u201cWe knew what that would bring, and we tried to prevent it,\u201d Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said at Sunday\u2019s conference, referring to the 2005 withdrawal, Reuters reported. \u201cWithout settlements, there is no security.\u201d\nItamar Ben Gvir, the country\u2019s national security minister, also a featured speaker, added separately: \u201cIf we don\u2019t want another October 7, we need to go back home and control [Gaza]. We need to find a legal way to voluntarily emigrate [Palestinians] and impose death sentences on terrorists,\u201d Haaretz reported.\nAdvertisement\nThe Times of Israel reported that in all, 12 Israeli cabinet ministers and 15 additional members of the Israeli Knesset who are part of Israel\u2019s governing coalition attended the conference. (Axios reported 18 coalition lawmakers attended.) The event was entitled \u201cConference for the Victory of Israel - Settlement Brings Security: Returning to the Gaza Strip and Northern Samaria.\u201d Samaria, in this context, is a reference to the northern West Bank, where some Israeli settlements were also evacuated in 2005. Thousands of people reportedly attended Sunday\u2019s conference.\nThere have been numerous calls from high-ranking Israelis for so-called \u201cvoluntary\u201d migration from Gaza, including from Smotrich and Ben Gvir but also Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi, who is a member of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party.\nOn Sunday, Karhi reiterated past comments, telling the conference that in war, \u201c\u2018voluntary\u2019 is at times a state you impose [on someone] until they give their consent.\u2019\u201d\nNetanyahu has not himself joined calls for the Israeli re-settlement of Gaza, though he has reportedly said his government was \u201cworking on\u201d finding countries willing to absorb Gazans. Some Israeli troops in Gaza are engaged in a campaign to demolish buildings close to the boundary between Israel and the Strip to create a \u201cbuffer zone\u201d within Gaza. Twenty-one Israeli soldiers were killed last week while laying explosives to demolish Palestinian buildings, reportedly during a firefight with Palestinian militants.\nNetanyahu also said earlier this month, \u201cIn any future arrangement \u2026 Israel needs security control of all territory west of the Jordan [River],\u201d which includes both the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\nAdvertisement\nSouth Africa, in its case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) accusing Israel of genocide, alleged that Netanyahu\u2019s government risked a repeat of the 1948 \u201cNakba,\u201d in which the establishment of the state of Israel led to the violent displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their ancestral homes.\n\u201cThe forced displacements in Gaza are genocidal, in that they are taking place in circumstances calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians in Gaza,\u201d South Africa\u2019s application to the ICJ read, after referencing the widespread destruction of housing stock in Gaza. The document added later: \u201cA forced displacement beyond Palestinian land, reminiscent of the 1948 Nakba, must be prevented.\u201d The court subsequently recognised the risk of genocide in the Strip and ordered Israel to prevent its military from committing acts of genocide in Gaza.\nAsked on Saturday about Sunday\u2019s conference, Netanyahu said members of his government slated to attend were \u201centitled to their opinions\u201d but that his position on re-settling the Strip \u201chas not changed,\u201d Haaretz reported. Opposition leader Yair Lapid said the conference showed that Netanyahu and the Likud party had been \u201cdragged aimlessly after extremists.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.huffingtonpost.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Senior Israeli Officials Speak At Conference On Resettling Gaza Strip", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/senior-israeli-officials-speak-at-conference-on-resettling-gaza-strip_uk_65b8b220e4b077c17ab6489f"}
