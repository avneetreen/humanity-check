I say to the Hamas terrorists: It's over. Don't die for (Yahya) Sinwar. Surrender now,\" he said, referring to the Hamas chief in Gaza.\nThe army said Sunday it struck more than 250 targets in 24 hours, including \"a Hamas military communications site\", \"underground tunnel shafts\" in southern Gaza, and a Hamas military command centre in Shejaiya.\nIt says 98 soldiers have died and around 600 wounded in the Gaza campaign.\nSome 7,000 \"terrorists\" have been killed, according to National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi.\n\"Hamas should not exist, because they are not human beings, after what I saw they did,\" Menahem, a 22-year-old soldier wounded on October 7, told AFP during a military-organised tour that did not allow him to give his surname.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the Security Council's \"authority and credibility were severely undermined\", after the United States blocked a ceasefire resolution on Friday.\n\"I can promise, I will not give up,\" Guterres told Qatar's Doha Forum.\nQatar, where Hamas's top leadership is based, said it was still working on a new truce like the week-long ceasefire it helped mediate last month that saw 80 Israeli hostages exchanged for 240 Palestinian prisoners and humanitarian aid.\nBut Israel's relentless bombardment was \"narrowing the window\" for success, said Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday again rejected a ceasefire.\n\"With Hamas still alive, still intact and... with the stated intent of repeating October 7 again and again and again, that would simply perpetuate the problem,\" he told ABC News.\nBut Blinken also told CNN that Israeli forces should ensure \"military operations are designed around civilian protection\".\nIn Rafah in southern Gaza, one displaced woman said she had been stuck there for 18 days despite having an Egyptian passport.\n\"Whenever I want to go somewhere, we hear bombing and shelling and feel scared and go back,\" said Noura al-Sayed Hassan.\n\"I've been searching for bread for my daughter for over a week now.\"\nThe head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) voiced alarm over what he feared would be a mass expulsion of Palestinians into Egypt.\nIn an opinion piece Saturday in the Los Angeles Times, Philippe Lazzarini said \"the developments we are witnessing point to attempts to move Palestinians into Egypt\".\nAn Israeli spokesman responded: \"There is not, never was, and never will be an Israeli plan to move the residents of Gaza to Egypt.\"\nThe fighting in Gaza has sparked pro-Palestinian protests in many countries, including large gatherings in Morocco, Denmark and Turkey on Sunday.\nBut there were also demonstrations against anti-Semitism, including in Brussels where European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen helped light a huge Hanukkah menorah candelabrum.\nThere are fears of regional escalation with frequent cross-border exchanges between Israel and Lebanese militants, and attacks by pro-Iran groups against US and allied forces in Iraq and Syria.\nSyrian state news agency SANA reported late Sunday that Israeli strikes hit targets near the capital Damascus, although the country's air defense systems was able to deter some \"and losses were limited to materials\".\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Israeli bombings \"targeted Lebanese Hezbollah sites\" including areas near the Damascus International Airport, noting that the bombing \"was in three rounds\".\nMeanwhile, Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels threatened to attack any vessels heading to Israel unless more aid was allowed into Gaza.\nFrance said Sunday one of its frigates in the Red Sea had shot down two drones launched from Yemen.", "source_domain": "www.ibtimes.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Hamas Warns Hostages Doomed Unless Demands Met", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hamas-warns-hostages-doomed-unless-demands-met-1722105"}
