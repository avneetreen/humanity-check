She was drinking. Her skirt was too short. She went willingly back to the footballer\u2019s mansion, or up to Harvey Weinstein\u2019s hotel suite, so what did she think was going to happen? Maybe she was a teenage runaway, or a sex worker; he was a good boy, or a much-loved celebrity. There is a long list of reasons rapists get away with it, but it all too often starts with a jury\u2019s refusal to listen to a woman they have already decided for some stubborn reason not to like. Remember that, as we come to the distressing picture now emerging of alleged multiple rapes and sexual assaults by Hamas fighters amid the atrocities of 7 October.\nThis week, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, finally called for what he described as \u201cnumerous accounts of sexual violence during the abhorrent acts of terror by Hamas\u201d to be \u201cvigorously investigated\u201d.\nHarrowing stories had begun emerging within days from the desert rave where traumatised young women, who survived only by hiding from the gunmen, described watching in silent horror as other women were gang raped, mutilated and shot. Israeli women\u2019s rights groups, worried that chances to collect forensic evidence were missed in the initial chaos of a country under attack, swiftly mobilised \u2013 and last week, Dr Cochav Elkayam-Levy, the lawyer chairing a civil commission hastily created to document crimes against women and children during the massacre, flew to meet UN officials to discuss the testimony collated. Look away now if you would rather not read about women and young girls found dead with their pants pulled down, and telltale evidence of bleeding, bruises and scratches; about smashed pelvises, semen samples, and graphic details I wouldn\u2019t normally go into on these pages except that otherwise it seems people don\u2019t believe it. Though some won\u2019t, even then.\nRape is a war crime as old as war itself, and yet still often invisible thanks to the stigma surrounding survivors, the practical challenges of gathering evidence under fire, and bleakly, sometimes also the lack of survivors. But in recent years we have at least got better at recognising a pattern deserving of investigation. So when tales of Islamic State fighters raping and enslaving Yazidi women began to surface, or when horrific stories started filtering out from women in occupied Ukraine last year, I don\u2019t remember too many sceptics demanding to see video proof. Nor do I recall many victim support workers responding as the director of the Sexual Assault Centre at the University of Alberta in Canada did after 7 October, by signing an open letter condemning genocide in Gaza that criticised a Canadian politician for repeating \u201cthe unverified accusation that Palestinians were guilty of sexual violence\u201d. Only in this conflict have some normally proud progressives seemingly gone out of their way to show they don\u2019t always #BelieveWomen, after all.\nThe response to Jews posting about the issue on X this week has ranged from casual whataboutery to a gruesome variant of the \u201cpics or it didn\u2019t happen\u201d school of online scepticism, questioning why there aren\u2019t any actual live rapes visible on that grisly compilation of atrocities the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are currently screening to select opinion formers. (The film, compiled from security camera footage and terrorists\u2019 GoPros, includes only material that survivors\u2019 families have expressly consented to publishing \u2013 not everyone wants their child\u2019s last moments made public \u2013 and the IDF says some scenes judged too distressing or intrusive were excluded.) Evidently the stomach-turning images millions have already seen online \u2013 a dead woman, lying with her skirt pulled above her waist and no underwear on; the young woman bundled out of a truck in the Gaza Strip, the crotch of her jogging bottoms soaked in blood \u2013 aren\u2019t enough for some.\nWhy do people who would probably happily judge an allegedly predatory actor or MP based on little more than hearsay seemingly struggle to entertain doubts about the sexual conduct of a terrorist, as if to do so would somehow be a betrayal of the Palestinian cause? For those who still conceive of Hamas gunmen as freedom fighters engaged in glorious resistance, it\u2019s perhaps easier to rationalise away dead women than raped ones. It\u2019s a war, they might tell themselves, and people die in war; anyway, look how many thousands more innocent women and children have died in Gaza. But a crime so obviously born of misogyny, revenge and exploitative power is not so easily explained away. For those who can\u2019t deal with the troubling cognitive dissonance, the easiest thing is to decide that it just didn\u2019t happen. The survivors must be liars, along with the first responders who reported finding half-naked bodies with injuries I won\u2019t describe here, and the pathologists and women\u2019s rights activists and news agencies claiming to have been shown supporting photographs and ambassadors saying they believe what they\u2019ve heard from morgue workers; liars, the lot of them. Because if they aren\u2019t, what are you?\nAlmost two months have now elapsed since 7 October, and in that short time, the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry says that more than 15,000 Palestinians have died in Gaza. The current truce may not hold much longer, and the consequences if the fighting spreads to the impossibly overcrowded south don\u2019t bear thinking about. The war crimes allegedly committed by Israel against Palestinians during this conflict obviously require investigation every bit as urgently as the ones that triggered it, and the UN\u2019s ability to investigate rape claims has doubtless not been helped by the Netanyahu government\u2019s reluctance to engage with a body that has been repeatedly and justifiably critical of Israel\u2019s past actions in the occupied territories.\nBut all that said, this isn\u2019t some ghoulish competition, nor a zero-sum game where any empathy shown to dead Israelis somehow leaves less available for Palestinians. Collectively, our international institutions must be capable of keeping more than one wrong in mind at once. And individually, we should expect of ourselves what we ask of juries, judges and police every time they hear a rape case, which is not to unquestioningly believe every word, but to listen with compassion and an open mind. A war crime is a war crime, regardless of who committed it. And rape is rape, even when perpetrated against someone you secretly don\u2019t want to think of as a victim.\nGaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Whatever your view of the Israel-Hamas war, rape is rape.
