About $23.6 billion of that was pulled from existing military stockpiles and almost $19 billion was sent in the form of longer-term military contracts, for items that will take months to procure. So even though funds have run out, some previously purchased weapons will continue to flow in. An additional $1.7 billion has been provided by the U.S. State Department in the form of foreign military financing.\nThe U.S. and approximately 30 international partners are also continuing to train Ukrainian forces, and to date have trained a total of 118,000 Ukrainians at locations around the world, said Col. Marty O\u2019Donnell, spokesman for U.S. Army Europe and Africa.\nThe United States has trained approximately 18,000 of those fighters, including approximately 16,300 soldiers in Germany. About 1,500 additional fighters are currently going through training.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "The Pentagon has no more money for Ukraine as it hosts a meeting of 50 allies on support for Kyiv", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pentagon-ap-united-states-ukraine-lloyd-austin-b2483055.html"}
