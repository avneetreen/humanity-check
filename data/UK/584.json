A third group tried to approach to evacuate the wounded and was also hit by an explosion.\nThe ambush came despite daily claims by the IDF that it is close to having operational control of key Hamas strongholds in the north of Gaza.\nGreenberg had risen to public prominence after the 7 October attack, describing in an interview how he had rescued two infant twins whose parents had been killed by Hamas in Kfar Aza.\nReferring to the soldiers who were killed on Tuesday, the Israeli minister Benny Gantz said Israel was paying \u201ca heavy, painful, and difficult price\u201d.\nThe ambush came amid unconfirmed media reports that Israel had started to pump seawater into some of Hamas\u2019s tunnel system. Asked about the claims, made in the Wall Street Journal, the US president, Joe Biden, declined to directly answer, referring only to assertions that there were no hostages in the areas targeted.\n\u201cWith regard to the flooding \u2026 I\u2019m not at lib\u2026 well. There are assertions being made that \u2026 there are no hostages in any of these tunnels. But I don\u2019t know that for a fact,\u201d Biden said.\nView image in fullscreen Palestinians take shelter in tents in Deir al-Balah, Gaza.

One hundred and fifty-three countries voted in favour of the ceasefire, 10 countries voted against and 23 abstained or were absent.\nOn Tuesday Israel and the US had their sharpest public disagreement yet over the conduct and future of the war as the two allies became increasingly isolated by global calls for a ceasefire.\nThe dispute emerged while Israeli forces carried out strikes across Gaza, crushing Palestinians in homes. Biden said he had told the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that Israel was losing international support because of its \u201cindiscriminate bombing\u201d and that Netanyahu should change his government, which is dominated by hard-right parties.\nThe UN general assembly resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire is largely symbolic but serves as an important barometer of world opinion. None of the major powers joined Israel and the US in their opposition to the ceasefire.\nJake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, will head to Israel this week to discuss with Netanyahu a timetable for the war and what happens if Hamas is defeated. The defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, will travel to Israel next week for a visit that the Pentagon said was intended to show US support for Israel but also to press the need to avoid more civilian casualties in Gaza.\nThe war ignited by Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack in Israel has already brought unprecedented death and destruction to the impoverished coastal territory, with much of northern Gaza obliterated, more than 18,000 Palestinians killed, according to Gaza authorities, and more than 80% of the population of 2.3 million pushed from their homes.\nThe US has urged Israel to do more to reduce civilian casualties since it launched its ground invasion of southern Gaza at the beginning of the month. But the toll has continued to mount at seemingly the same dizzying rate.\nThe healthcare system and humanitarian aid operations have collapsed in large parts of Gaza amid Israel\u2019s blockade of the territory and intense airstrikes and fighting, and aid workers have warned of starvation and the spread of disease among displaced people in overcrowded shelters and tent camps.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Gaza: Israeli commanders among nine soldiers killed in Hamas ambush", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/13/gaza-israel-soldiers-killed-hamas-ambush"}
