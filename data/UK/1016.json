Israeli military officials said their forces had killed at least five.\nThe raid underlined the high tensions in the West Bank since the attacks launched by Hamas into southern Israel last month that prompted a massive Israeli military offensive into Gaza.\nThe mounting death toll in the West Bank has underscored fears that the territory seized by Israel in the 1967 war could spiral out of control amid the conflict in Gaza.\nHamas\u2019s al-Quds Brigades in Jenin said in a statement on Friday they had engaged Israeli forces for several hours, unleashing a \u201ctorrent of fire\u201d and laying ambushes with explosives.\nAn Israeli military spokesperson said an armed \u201cterrorist cell that fired at Israeli security forces\u201d was struck by an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) aircraft.\n\u201cAdditional terrorists who fired and hurled explosive devices at the security forces were neutralised,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThe Israeli military said some Hamas militants fled in vehicles and ambulances toward Jenin\u2019s Ibn Sina hospital, and that troops stopped one of the vehicles at the entrance to the hospital. It released video footage of soldiers searching a car at the hospital and finding M-16 rifles and ammunition.\nPalestinian health officials said some hospital workers were ordered to exit the hospital, with a verified video showing them walking out of the building, holding up their hands. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society accused the IDF of detaining and searching ambulance crews.\nLast week, Israeli forces raided Jenin and fought for hours with gunmen in a battle in which 14 people were killed, one of the heaviest clashes in the occupied West Bank in months.\nAt least 191 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and as many as 2,000 detained amid a strict clampdown. Israeli officials say the arrests have thwarted several significant attacks.\nLast month\u2019s attacks by Hamas killed 1,200, mostly civilians, with more than 240 taken hostage. Palestinian civilians have borne the brunt of Israel\u2019s weeks-long military campaign in Gaza.\nGaza health authorities say at least 11,500 people have been confirmed killed in an Israeli bombardment and ground invasion \u2013 more than 4,700 of them children.\nA senior Israeli military officer told the Guardian last week that the West Bank was a \u201cbroad front\u201d where the Israeli army was already deploying significant forces against Hamas and would not hesitate to intensify its efforts if necessary.\nIsraeli security forces also shot dead an attacker near Hebron after he opened fire on soldiers on Friday morning. On Thursday, an Israeli soldier was killed at a checkpoint on the West Bank\u2019s route 60.\nItamar Ben-Gvir, Israel\u2019s national security minister, said Israel needed to deal with Hamas in the West Bank \u201cexactly like we are dealing with Gaza\u201d.\nBen-Gvir, the leader of the far-right party Jewish Power, also said the Palestinian Authority \u201chas similar views to Hamas and its heads identify with Hamas\u2019s massacre\u201d and should be dealt with in the same way.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel kills Hamas militants in Jenin raid as violence surges in West Bank", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/17/israel-kills-hamas-militants-in-jenin-raid-as-violence-surges-in-west-bank"}
