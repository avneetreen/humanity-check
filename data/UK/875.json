The urge to flee has become common enough that they also talk of 500s \u2014 people who refuse to fight.\nAs the war grinds into its second winter, a growing number of Russian soldiers want out, as suggested in secret recordings obtained by The Associated Press of Russian soldiers calling home from the battlefields of the Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions in Ukraine.\nThe calls offer a rare glimpse of the war as it looked through Russian eyes \u2014 a point of view that seldom makes its way into Western media, largely because Russia has made it a crime to speak honestly about the conflict in Ukraine. They also show clearly how the war has progressed, from the professional soldiers who initially powered Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion to men from all walks of life compelled to serve in grueling conditions.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no f------ \u2018dying the death of the brave\u2019 here,\u201d one soldier told his brother from the front in Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region. \u201cYou just die like a f------ earthworm.\u201d\nThe prospect of another wave of mobilization lingers, even as Moscow has been trying to lure people into signing contracts with the military. Russia\u2019s annual autumn conscription draft kicked off in October, pulling in some 130,000 fresh young men. Though Moscow says conscripts won\u2019t be sent to Ukraine, after a year of service they automatically become reservists \u2014 prime candidates for mobilization.\nRussia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin attends a press conference with his Belarus counterpart, following their talks at the Kremlin in Moscow on February 18, 2022 (Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe AP verified the identities of people in the calls by speaking with relatives and soldiers \u2014 some of whom are still at war in Ukraine \u2014 and researching open-source material linked to the phone numbers used by the soldiers.\nThe conversations, picked up in January 2023 \u2014 some from near the longest and deadliest fight in Bakhmut \u2014 have been edited for length and clarity. Names have been omitted to protect the soldiers and their relatives.\nThe voices in these calls are of men who didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t flee mobilization. Some had no money, no education and no options. Others believed in patriotic duty. One worked in a meat processing plant, cutting bone. Another worked at a law firm. A third, who worked as a roofer and later at a supermarket company, had a string of debts and had defaulted on his utilities payments, records show.\nIt is hard to say how representative these calls are of sentiment in Russia\u2019s armed forces, but their desperation is matched by a spike in legal cases against soldiers in Russia who refuse to fight.\nWhat\u2019s happening in Ukraine is \u201csimply genocide,\u201d the soldier in Kharkiv told his brother. \u201cIf this s--- doesn\u2019t stop, then soon we\u2019ll be leading the Ukrainians to the Kremlin ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is just a huge testing ground, where the whole world is testing their weapons, f--- it, and sizing up their d----,\u201d he went on. \"That\u2019s all.\u201d\nBut there are other voices, too, of men who remain committed to the fight.\n\u201cAs long as we are needed here, we will carry out our task,\u201d a soldier named Artyom told AP from eastern Ukraine at the end of May, where he\u2019d been stationed for eight months without break. \u201cJust stop asking me these stupid questions.\u201d\nThe Kremlin and Russian Ministry of Defense did not respond to requests for comment.\nSOLDIER: \u2018BONES, TEARS \u2014 ALL THE SAME, THEY ARE THE SAME AS WE ARE\u2019\nWhen he finally got to go home, it came at a terrible price: his brother\u2019s life.\nNicknamed \u201cCrazy Professor\u201d because of his disheveled hair, he was swept up in the first days of Russia\u2019s September 2022 draft. The soldier said he was assured that he wouldn\u2019t see combat and would get to go home every six months.\nNeither turned out to be true.\nAfter a few weeks of training, the Professor was sent to the front line near Bakhmut as a mortarman. He wanted out almost immediately. He was ill-equipped, at least compared to the well-camouflaged Wagner soldiers wandering around.\n\u201cThey have night vision and automatic rifles with cool silencers. I have an automatic rifle from 1986 or hell knows what year,\u201d he told his brother in a January phone call.\nIt was his job to aim, but the Russian army\u2019s coordinates were so sloppy that soldiers ended up killing each other.\nThe Professor said his commander instructed them not to kill civilians, but who was a civilian and who was a combatant? Even a kid could carry a grenade, he told his brother. Where did the mortars he fired land? Had he killed children?\nThe worst was when he was out with young guys in his unit. There was just a strip of woods between them and the Ukrainians.\n\u201cI imagined that there, on the other side, there could be young people just like us. And they have their whole lives ahead of them,\u201d he told AP in June. \u201cBones, tears \u2014 all the same, they are the same as we are.\u201d\nThe Professor told himself he didn\u2019t really have a choice: Either fire the mortar or face criminal charges and end up in a pit or a prison.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like something, if you refuse to do something, you\u2019re considered a refusenik,\" he told AP. \"That is, you\u2019re a \u2018500\u2019 right away. \u2026 So we had to follow orders. Whether we wanted to or not.\u201d\nThe Professor never thought he\u2019d be a refusenik one day too.\n___\nThe Professor: The worst thing is that there might even be children there, you know.\nBrother: And what can you do. \u2026 You have your orders. \u2026 It seems to me that if it had been voluntary, you wouldn\u2019t have gone.\nThe Professor: You know, I\u2019m glad about that. Plus, we did such a good job that they gave us a car. The downside is, you know, how many lives were ruined for the sake of a car?\nBrother: Not of your own free will.\nThe Professor: I\u2019m already so tired.\nBrother: I believe it. Time to come home. I wish you could come home. Not so that you could home but so that all of this could be over already.\n___\nIn the spring, as the Professor\u2019s brothers drove down a road outside their hometown in Russia, a car made a U-turn into the side of their vehicle, sending it spinning as a semi bore down on them.\nOne brother was killed. Another survived but now cannot walk, family members told AP.\nDesperate to go home to bury his brother, the Professor said he got approval from his commander for a 10-day leave. Military police in Russian-controlled territory in Luhansk let him through, he said, and he paid for his own taxi ride home. Once he got back to Russia, however, he was told he didn\u2019t have the right paperwork.\nNot long after the funeral, the Professor got a message from his commanding officer: \u201cWhat is happening there? Are you going to come back or stay there?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll collect the documents, and then we\u2019ll decide everything,\u201d he wrote back.\nTwo hours later, around midnight, his commander responded: \u201cI\u2019m reporting you as AWOL, unauthorized abandonment of the unit. It was nice fighting together.\u201d\nNow he faces up to 10 years in prison.\nHe hired a lawyer. Months into a 10-day leave, he can\u2019t even apply for an extension to legalize his stay and help his family because he doesn\u2019t have the right documents. He said his brother can move around on his arms and mostly get into his wheelchair by himself, but can't function independently.\nPeople from the military came to his home, he said. Terrified they\u2019d arrest him if he went outside, he passed documents attesting to the dire state of his family\u2019s health to them through the window.\nHis lawyer told him to look on the bright side. \u201cYou are the only, well, how do I put this \u2026 at least, you\u2019re the only healthy person here.\u201d\nHis mother is at the end of her endurance.\n\u201cI write everywhere, I call everywhere, too. Because he was told that he has to return to his unit,\u201d his mother told AP. \u201cBut how can he leave his brother? I have no one.\u201d\nNow, the Professor has visions of dead people. They stare back at him. He can almost hear them walking nearby. Sometimes he bolts awake at night, sweating, or dives under the covers at the sound of a whistle.\nHe wants his old life back, that sweet time he had with his wife and baby. He has picked up some roofing work at construction sites, and his neighbor proposed a new side job: digging graves.\nARTYOM: 'EVERYBODY'S F------ MAD, F------ GLOOMY AS HELL'\nArtyom left behind a string of debts in Russia. Things got even worse in Ukraine, where it was so cold he couldn\u2019t wash his underwear and his lighter kept freezing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m having any f------ fun here, day in day out. It\u2019s been f------ four months already,\u201d he told his wife in January. \u201cEverybody\u2019s f------ mad, f------ gloomy as hell.\u201d\nIt was New Year\u2019s Day, and the Russians were getting bombarded by Ukrainians and not even firing back, he said.\n\u201cYesterday we were f------ bombarded, for f---\u2019s sake, we didn\u2019t even get a single shell out, not a single f------ shell,\u201d he told his wife.\nThe war seemed senseless to him. Why wasn\u2019t Putin satisfied with Crimea? What business did they have trying to take Kharkiv and Kyiv? Why was everyone lying about how great things were at the front?\nNo one was saying the one thing he wanted to hear: that he could go home.\n___\nArtyom: Yesterday we were listening to the radio and someone f------ said, \u201cthe situation with mobilized soldiers is f------ wonderful.\u201d I don\u2019t know who the f------ idiot is who said that. \u201cOnly five thousand people died.\u201d\nWife: Mhm. Of course.\nArtyom: F------ s---heads. I think half of them are probably gone at this point.\nWife: Right.\nArtyom: Five thousand people my ass.\n___\nArtyom doesn\u2019t have much sympathy for draft dodgers and deserters, though he can see the wisdom in making a run for it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you have to do, given the chance,\u201d he told his wife. \u201cThis is not the best f------ place to be \u2026 But then they\u2019re gonna say you\u2019re a f------ freak who ran away. I don\u2019t f------ need that.\u201d\nHe told her he\u2019ll stay put and follow orders. \u201cIf God wills it so that you\u2019re gonna f------ die, you\u2019re gonna f------ die, can\u2019t do much about it.\u201d\nThe AP reached Artyom by phone at the end of May. He was still in eastern Ukraine, where he\u2019d been serving for eight months without break.\nArtyom said he\u2019d been \u201ca little worn out mentally\u201d when he was speaking with his wife. He said he loved his family before the war and loved them even more now. He regrets he didn\u2019t spend more time with them.\n\u201cI have to save the guys who are with me in the trenches \u2014 and myself,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do. And to put down the Ukrainians faster and go home.\u201d\nROMAN: \u2018I ALREADY FEEL MORE PITY SHOOTING A BIRD THAN A PERSON\u2019\nAfter two months on the front lines north of Bakhmut, Roman had some advice for his friend and former colleague back in Russia: Avoid this war any way you can.\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you honestly, if there\u2019s even a slight chance, get exempted from service. But if the summons comes for mobilization, f--- it to hell. Join Wagner or the contract soldiers, or wherever you can. God forbid the mobilized. The mobilized are the lowest.\u201d\nRoman explained that professional contract soldiers are taken care of: They get to go on leave, launder their clothes and bathe. They don\u2019t have to struggle for food and water.\nMeanwhile, mobilized soldiers like him are shoved in trenches with men from all walks of life, some of whom don\u2019t even know how to hold guns. They never get to leave, and their commanders \u2014 \u201cweak wusses,\u201d he says \u2014 aren\u2019t much help. He\u2019s had to buy night vision goggles with his own money. There\u2019s not enough to eat and no clean drinking water. Soldiers are licking at snowflakes and scooping up rainwater to drink. He said he lost 30 kilos (over 60 pounds). The diarrhea hasn\u2019t helped.\n\u201cIt came to the point that there were puddles, it had rained, and the guys scooped up all the puddles and drank,\u201d Roman told his friend. \u201cSnow fell, f------ s---, and the snow didn\u2019t even reach the ground, the guys caught it and ate it.\u201d\nWhen he arrived in Ukraine in November 2022, Roman was part of a unit of 100 men. By early January, about a third were gone.\nRoman said he\u2019s been lucky twice. Once he got food poisoning and stayed back while a group of scouts went out. They never came back. Another time, he was carrying water and tripped and fell just as a shell landed, killing others nearby.\nSurrounded by a horseshoe of Ukrainian troops, Roman said it was like being on the tip of a toilet seat, in constant fear that their supply lines, thin as they were, would get cut off.\nRoman had to scoop a man\u2019s guts back into his body \u2014 an act that didn\u2019t save the guy\u2019s life. Another time, he went out to defecate in a field, and tanks started firing around him. He just kept squatting till he was done. After two months of living like this, so scared you\u2019ll shoot at the softest sound in the dark, even the strongest minds started to fray.\n\u201cWe survive because we are on edge all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cEven guys from our own side don\u2019t come close, especially at night. When we are on duty, we warn everyone that we will shoot at anything that rustles.\u201d\nRoman said his cousin was killed by a shell that took out a dozen soldiers. His family managed to get his body \u2014 or at least half of his body \u2014 back to Russia, but the other 11 soldiers lay unclaimed in Ukraine.\nIt wasn\u2019t just the killing that did people in, it was the sense that they\u2019d been forgotten.\n___\nRoman: Our group is made up of guys who are sufficiently strong, morally, and guys like that. It was the first wave. Guys came together who are sufficiently patriotic, roughly speaking, who knew what it was to fight. After two months, they start to lose it. For many of them, their psyche was broken.\nFriend: Yeah, I understand, all of the killing of course.\nRoman: Yes, the killing is everywhere. A f------ lot of corpses. Some were stabbed with a knife, but that\u2019s not the point. Psyches are not broken because of this. These are people who are professionals, it\u2019s our national army, these professionals come to our position. \u2018F---, it\u2019s f----- up here.\u2019 They turn around and leave. That is, they are replaced, they have rotation, they are given leave, their clothes are washed and ironed, they wash in the bathhouse, they have no problem with food, they have no problem with water. It\u2019s not like this for us. It once came to the point that there were puddles, it had rained, and the guys scooped up all the puddles and drank.\n___\nThe \u201cdepressing, horrible\u201d panic that attacked him at the beginning of his tour has subsided. The calls home help.\nOne night, Roman got pulled into a special mission. They snuck into a Ukrainian dugout, knives drawn, hacked up a bunch of men and captured a Ukrainian officer for questioning. Death was everywhere, on both sides of the front.\n\u201cF---, I already feel more pity shooting a bird than a person,\" Roman told his friend.\nContacted by the AP, both men declined to comment.\nANDREI: \u2018THE MOBILIZED ARE NOT CONSIDERED HUMANS\u2019\nAfter four months in Ukraine, Andrei concluded that his life meant nothing to Moscow.\nCalled up for military service from a small town in Russia\u2019s far east, he soon found himself in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk province, on the southern approach to Bakhmut.\nAndrei\u2019s unit was taking heavy losses, and no one was even shooting back at the Ukrainians, he said. People were dying from friendly fire. Mobilized men like him were being forced to sign contracts.\n\u201cThe mobilized are not considered humans,\u201d he told his mother. \u201cNo one gives a damn about us. They think that for 200,000 (rubles) we should die here.\u201d\nMutiny was in the air.\n___\nAndrei: Our boys are dying for nothing. It\u2019s nonsense, I tell you. This is not a war at all. When I come back, I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s going on here. It\u2019s all bull----. I\u2019m telling you, our boys are dying, going 300, and no one even shoots back. It\u2019s all nonsense. Our artillery is hammering our own dugouts, not theirs. What is that?\nMother: What for?\nAndrei: They, like, miss the mark. \u2026 Here, if they don\u2019t get you, your own will.\nMother: (Inaudible)\nAndrei: I\u2019m telling you, you just start going nuts here, like everything pisses you off. Because you can\u2019t do s--- about it. Nobody gives a s---. It\u2019s a half year and that\u2019s it. F--- them. If they don\u2019t relieve us, if they don\u2019t pull us out, the whole company will just walk away. They can\u2019t put a crowd of 100 people on trial.\nMother: They have no right to keep you longer.\nAndrei: No one gives a damn here. We were told the other day that they forgot about us a little bit here. But they didn\u2019t just forget about us \u2014 they f----- us.\n___\nMobilized soldiers like him are treated worst of all, he told his mom. They\u2019re not allowed to leave \u2014 even if they get injured \u2014 because commanders fear they\u2019ll never come back.\n___\nAndrei: Well, our guys are getting killed in droves.\nMother: Judging by what I \u2014\nAndrei: I\u2019m telling you. In droves from our side. If a contract soldier is wounded, he\u2019s sent home. If a mobilized soldier is wounded, they treat him, patch him up a bit, and tell him to go the f--- back, why the hell are you dodging? All in all, if you get sick here, you will not be sent home. They won\u2019t give a damn, and you\u2019ll die in this pit where you live in. You can\u2019t get sick here at all.\nMother: Better not get sick. (Inaudible)\nAndrei: This is how s--- works here. As long as you are useful, they like know who you are. And when you become useless, then nobody needs you. They forget about you.\n___\nHe said the only reason he\u2019s still alive is luck and regrets finding himself at war. \u201cThis is my only mistake in life,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not fall into the same trap twice.\u201d\n\u201cGod gives you one chance,\u201d his mother responded. \u201cGod willing, you\u2019ll come home.\u201d\nIn September, Andrei\u2019s mother told AP her son was home, keeping himself busy with his family and collecting pine cones from the taiga.\nShe said she was born in Ukraine and her mother still lives there. She said it pains her that Ukraine is now filled with \u201ctraitors and fascists.\u201d\n\u201cI hate your current rulers,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you blind or stupid? Or can\u2019t you see that there are no normal people? Or do you want your children to turn into monkeys, like in America? What is this? I don\u2019t recognize my homeland, where I was born and went to school.\u201d\n___\nAP reporters Lynn Berry in Washington and Alla Konstantinova in Vilnius, Lithuania, contributed to this report.
