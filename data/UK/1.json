So there will be consequences, and I\u2019ll just leave it at that\u201d.\nAfter Maj Gen Ryder was asked about a purported message on Telegram from Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah warning its fighters to refrain from attacking US bases or personnel, even in response to an American strike, he replied that the Pentagon was aware of the alleged message but declined to elaborate further.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen those reports. I don\u2019t have a specific comment to provide other than actions speak louder than words,\u201d he said.\nJoe Biden speaks to the media at the White House on Tuesday (AP)\nThe Pentagon spokesperson told reporters he would not \u201cget into any details\u201d about what form the response to the Sunday attack could take, although he noted that both Mr Biden and defense secretary Lloyd Austin have both promised that the US would response \u201cin a time [and] in a manner of our choosing\u201d.\nUS officials have posited that the drone escaped air defence systems because it was mistaken for a separate, US-owned aircraft that was returning to the base.\nMaj Gen Ryder addressed the drone attack in an initial statement during the briefing on Tuesday saying, \u201cIn terms of additional details about the drone attack itself, we know there are still many questions to include how the one-way attack drone could have penetrated the facility\u2019s air defences, its point of origin and which specific Iranian proxy group is responsible\u201d.\nWhile the US has not specifically attributed the attack to any particular group, the president also told reporters that he holds Iran responsible for the attack because that country\u2019s government is \u201csupplying the weapons to the people who did it\u201d, though he declined to say whether a direct link between Tehran and the attacks has been established by US intelligence.\nMaj Gen Ryder echoed Mr Biden\u2019s sentiments in his comments to the Pentagon press corps, though he, too, declined to attribute the attack to a specific group.\n\u201cWhat we do know is that Iran-backed militias are responsible for these continued attacks on US forces and that we will respond at a time and manner of our choosing. While we do not seek to escalate tensions in the region, we will also take all necessary actions to protect our troops or facilities in our interests,\u201d he added.\nIn the days since the drone attack, some Republicans have been calling for the US to respond by attacking targets within Iran\u2019s borders, while Biden administration officials have been contemplating several different response scenarios, including strikes on Iranian proxies and a strike on an Iranian naval ship in the Persian Gulf.\nBut Mr Biden said he did not want to see the situation escalate into a broader regional conflict. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need a wider war in the Middle East. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for,\u201d he said.\nOver the weekend, Mr Biden had promised a US response to the deadly incident, which is widely believed to be part of a campaign orchestrated by Tehran to escalate tensions and inflict damage on the US and its allies in the Middle East.\nNational Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Monday that \u201cthere\u2019s a responsibility that appropriately needs to be laid at the feet of leaders in Tehran\u201d for the attacks and noted that the Iranian government \u201cclearly\u201d continues to support militant groups that have been attacking US positions, ships, and international commercial shipping in the Red Sea.\nThe drone attack struck a housing trailer on the small, remote US base, known as Tower 22, and killed the three soldiers occupying it while wounding more than 40 others, with eight of the casualties requiring evacuation to a medical facility in Iraq.\nThe Pentagon on Monday identified the soldiers as Sgt William Jerome Rivers, 46, of Carrollton, Georgia; Specialist Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, of Waycross, Georgia; and Specialist Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23, of Savannah, Georgia. All three were army reservists assigned to the 718th Engineer Company, 926th Engineer Battalion, 926th Engineer Brigade out of Fort Moore, Georgia.",
