Israel accuses Hamas of using Palestinians as human shields, while Palestinians and rights groups say Israel has recklessly endangered civilians as it seeks to eradicate the group.\nMohammed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in Gaza, said Israeli tanks had entered the medical compound and that soldiers had entered buildings including the emergency and surgery departments, which house intensive care units.\n\u201cThe occupation forces stormed the buildings,\u201d he said angrily over the phone. He said the patients, including children, are terrified. \u201cThey are screaming. It\u2019s a very terrifying situation ... we can do nothing for the patients but pray.\u201d\nThe Israeli military said it was carrying out a \u201cprecise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa Hospital.\u201d It said it warned \u201crelevant authorities in Gaza\u201d that all military activities within the hospital must cease. \u201cUnfortunately, it did not.\u201d\nIsrael says Hamas has a massive command center inside and beneath Shifa, but has not provided visual evidence, while Hamas and the hospital staff have repeatedly denied the allegations. Hours before the raid, the United States said it had its own intelligence suggesting Hamas used Shifa and other hospitals, and tunnels beneath them, to support military operations and hold hostages.\nThe military said that the forces raiding Shifa have medical teams and are searching for hostages as part of the operation.\nIsraeli forces also claimed control of several key buildings and a downtown neighborhood in Gaza City.\nA TRICKLE OF FUEL FOR AID WORKERS\nMost of the hundreds of thousands of people living in Gaza City and surrounding areas have fled after weeks of Israeli bombardments. Hardly any aid has been delivered to the the north, which has been without power or running water for weeks.\nMore than 11,200 people, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah, and two thirds of the territory's 2.3 million people have fled their homes. About 2,700 people have been reported missing. The ministry\u2019s count does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths.\nAlmost the entire population of Gaza has squeezed into the southern two-thirds of the tiny territory, where conditions have been deteriorating as bombardment there continues.\nThe U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said Tuesday that its fuel depot in Gaza was empty and that it would soon cease relief operations, including bringing limited supplies of food and medicine in from Egypt for the more than 600,000 people sheltering in severely overcrowded U.N.-run schools and other facilities in the south.\n\"Without fuel, the humanitarian operation in Gaza is coming to an end. Many more people will suffer and will likely die,\u201d said Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA.\nIsraeli defense officials changed course early Wednesday to allow some 24,000 liters (6,340 gallons) of fuel in for humanitarian efforts, officials said. Earlier, they repeatedly rejected allowing fuel into Gaza, saying Hamas would divert it for military use.\nCOGAT, the Israeli defense body responsible for Palestinian affairs, said it would allow U.N. trucks to refill at the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian border later Wednesday. It said the decision was made in response to a request from the U.S.\nHOSPITALS NO LONGER FUNCTIONING\nThousands of displaced people who had been sheltering at Shifa, along with patients who were able to move, had fled the medical compound in Gaza City through a corridor established by Israeli forces in recent days as Israeli troops encircled the complex and battled Hamas militants outside its gates.\nShifa had stopped operations over the weekend, as its supplies dwindled and a lack of electricity left it no way to run incubators and other lifesaving equipment. After days without refrigeration, morgue stuff dug a mass grave Tuesday for 120 bodies in the yard.\nThe Health Ministry said 40 patients, including three babies, have died since Shifa\u2019s emergency generator ran out of fuel Saturday. Another 36 babies are at risk of dying because there is no power for incubators, according to the ministry.\nThe Israeli military said it started an effort to transfer incubators to Shifa. But they would be useless without electricity, said Christian Lindmeier, a World Health Organization spokesman.\nThe Health Ministry has proposed evacuating the hospital with the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross and transferring the patients to hospitals in Egypt, but it has not received any response, ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said.\nWhile Israel says it is willing to allow staff and patients to evacuate, some Palestinians who have made it out say Israeli forces have fired at evacuees.\nThe White House\u2019s national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said Tuesday that the U.S. has unspecified intelligence that Hamas and other Palestinian militants use Shifa and other hospitals and tunnels underneath them to support military operations and hold hostages.\nThe intelligence is based on multiple sources, and the U.S. independently collected the information, a U.S. official said on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.\nKirby said the U.S. doesn't support airstrikes on hospitals and does not want to see \u201ca firefight in a hospital where innocent people\" are trying to get care.\nBATTLE IN GAZA CITY\nIsraeli troops have extended their control across northern Gaza, capturing the territory\u2019s legislature building and police headquarters. But independent accounts of the fighting in Gaza City have been nearly impossible to gather, as communications with the north have largely collapsed.\nIsraeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said Israeli forces have completed the takeover of Shati refugee camp, a densely built district bordering Gaza City\u2019s center, and are moving about freely in the city as a whole.\nInside some of the newly captured buildings, soldiers held up the Israeli flag and military flags in celebration. In a nationally televised news conference, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas had \u201clost control\u201d of northern Gaza and that Israel made significant gains in Gaza City.\nBut asked about the time frame for the war, Gallant said: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about long months, not a day or two.\u201d\nThe military says its forces have found weapons and eliminated fighters in government buildings, schools and residential buildings.\nIsrael says it has killed several thousand fighters, including important mid-level commanders, while 46 of its own soldiers have been killed in Gaza.\n___\nMagdy reported from Cairo.
