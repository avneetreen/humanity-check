Nearly 85% of Gaza\u2019s population have fled their homes.\nMore than 18,700 Palestinians have been killed since Israel declared war on Hamas, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. Israel says 116 of its soldiers have died in its ground offensive after Hamas raided southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people \u2014 mostly civilians \u2014 and taking about 240 hostages.\nCurrently:\n\u2014 In Israel's killing of three hostages, some see the same excessive force directed at Palestinians.\n\u2014 Israel finds a large tunnel adjacent to the Gaza border, raising questions about prewar intelligence.\n\u2014 European nations step up calls for a Gaza cease-fire.\n\u2014 Find more of AP\u2019s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the war:\nA COMMERCIAL SHIP IS ATTACKED IN THE RED SEA\nA Cayman Islands-flagged tanker has been attacked in a crucial shipping route off Yemen, a U.S. military official said Monday.\nThe attack that targeted the Swan Atlantic, a chemical and oil products carrier, is the latest in a series of assaults on vessels in the Red Sea and its strategic Bab el-Mandeb Strait.\nThe attacks have been claimed by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who say they are targeting vessels linked to Israel in support of Palestinian militants.\nThe U.S. official said the vessel was attacked by multiple projectiles at about 9 a.m. local time.\nThe USS Carney, a U.S. warship which provides security to ships in the area, responded to the incident, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the attack.\nThe British military\u2019s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which monitors Mideast shipping lanes, also reported an incident in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, off Yemen\u2019s port of Mocha, and warned vessels in the area to exercise caution.\nIt reported \u201ca possible explosion in the water\" about 2 nautical miles from the vessel.\nThe Houthis did not immediately claim responsibility for the assault.\nRIGHTS WATCHDOG ACCUSES ISRAEL OF DELIBERATELY STARVING CIVILIANS\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Human Rights Watch is accusing Israel of deliberately starving Gaza\u2019s population, a method of warfare that it described as a war crime.\nThe New York-based rights organization said Monday that Israeli forces were \u201cdeliberately blocking the delivery of water, food, and fuel, while wilfully impeding humanitarian assistance (and) apparently razing agricultural areas\u201d\nThe United Nations\u2019 food agency reported on Dec. 14 that 56% of Gaza\u2019s households were experiencing \u201csevere levels of hunger,\u201d up from 38% two weeks earlier.\nHRW said that following the Oct. 7 attack by Gaza-based militants on Israel that killed around 1,200 people, top Israeli officials, including Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, made public statements \u201cexpressing their aim to deprive civilians in Gaza of food, water and fuel.\u201d Other Israeli officials have made statements conditioning the provision of humanitarian aid on the release of the approximately 240 hostages Palestinian militants took into Gaza, HRW said.\nThe starving of civilians is a war crime under international humanitarian law. For the first two months of the war, humanitarian aid was delivered to Gaza through a single border crossing from Egypt, severely restricting the amount of food and other supplies that could reach the coastal enclave\u2019s residents. After pressure from the United States, Israel reopened a second border-crossing into Gaza last week. But the amount of aid entering the territory is still less than half of prewar imports, even as needs have soared and fighting hinders delivery in many areas.\nThe AP has contacted Israeli officials for a response.\nUS DEFENSE OFFICIALS ARRIVE IN ISRAEL FOR TALKS WITH NETANYAHU\nTEL AVIV \u2014 U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. CQ Brown Jr. have arrived in Israel to discuss Israel\u2019s ongoing military operations against Hamas amid a growing political rift between Tel Aviv and Washington over the war.\nThe two defense leaders have spent decades of their military service focused on the Middle East. They are in Israel to focus on the tactical milestones of its campaign, amid hopes that the long-running military-to-military connections forged between the two allies can discuss the war\u2019s next steps even as the political strain between President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over differences on the bombardment campaign in Gaza grows.\nAustin and Brown are expected to meet with Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and the War Cabinet during their visit. They are also expected to address the media following the day-long talks.\nAustin, who oversaw the drawdown of forces in Iraq as major combat operations ended there, is also expected to offer guidance on how to shift into a more targeted, lower-intensity military campaign, something the White House is eager to achieve.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Live updates | Israel's allies step up calls for a halt to the assault on Gaza", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/israel-ap-lloyd-austin-gaza-palestinians-b2465894.html"}
