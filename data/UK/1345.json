Brian Mast compared Palestinians to Nazis and said 'very few' of them are innocent in a wild tirade on the House floor.\nWeeks ago Mast wore his military uniform from his time with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to work on Capitol Hill.\n'As the only member to serve with both the United States Army and the Israel Defense Forces, I will always stand with Israel,' he wrote on X.\nMast, who lost both of his legs during a blast while serving in Afghanistan, volunteered with the IDF in 2015.\n'I would encourage the other side to not so lightly throw around the idea of innocent Palestinian civilians. I don't think we would so lightly throw around the term innocent Nazi civilians,' the congressman said in a speech Wednesday.\nFlorida Republican Rep. Brian Mast compared Palestinians to Nazis and said 'very few' of them are innocent in a wild tirade on the House floor\n'I would encourage the other side to not so lightly throw around the idea of innocent Palestinian civilians. I don't think we would so lightly throw around the term innocent Nazi civilians,' the congressman said in a speech Wednesday\n'There are very few innocent Palestinian civilians. I haven't seen the videos of the innocent Palestinian civilians who were out there trying to protect the Israelis, that were out there trying to stop the attacks,' Mast went on.\nSince 2006, Hamas has ruled over the Gaza strip and its two million residents. Hamas won elections in a shock victory, winning 44 percent of the vote over Fatah's 41 percent, and no elections have been held since. Instead of sharing power with Fatah, Hamas began murdering Fatah members and the party largely fled to the West Bank.\nThe median age in Gaza is 18, meaning most of its residents were not eligible to vote in the last election.\nStill, there is a sentiment among some that Palestinians have not done enough to rise up against their brutal regime.\n'It\u2019s an entire nation out there that is responsible,' Israeli President Isaac Herzog said last month. 'This rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved, it\u2019s absolutely not true. They could\u2019ve risen up, they could have fought against that evil regime.'\nRep.

The House is set to vote Thursday on a $14 billion package that would be offset by cuts in funding to the IRS.\nThe Democratic-led Senate is unlikely to take it up, as Democrats argue the aid should not be offset and should be tied in with Ukraine and Taiwan military funding.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Republican compares Palestinian civilians to Nazis in controversial speech on the House floor - shortly after wearing an IDF uniform in Congress", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12699193/Republican-compares-Palestinian-civilians-Nazis-controversial-speech-House-floor-shortly-wearing-IDF-uniform-Congress.html?ns_mchannel=rssns_campaign=1490ito=1490"}
