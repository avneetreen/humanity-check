It has to stop,\u201d Griffiths said in an interview with the Guardian, adding that the small amount of aid being allowed into Gaza could no longer be distributed, since the Israeli ground offensive had spread to southern Gaza and the city of Khan Younis, bringing the humanitarian operation effectively to an end.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t really a statistically significant operation any more,\u201d said Griffiths, who is also UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a patch on a wound and it doesn\u2019t do the job, and it would be an illusion for the world to think that the people in Gaza can be helped by the humanitarian operation under these conditions.\n\u201cThis is an apocalyptic situation now, because these are the remnants of a nation being driven into a pocket in the south.\u201d\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a ground operation into northern Gaza on 27 October, 20 days after Hamas militants killed 1,200 Israelis, most of them civilians, in a cross-border attack. Israel told Palestinian civilians to move into southern Gaza for their own safety before the ground assault, but the south also remained under bombardment. After the breakdown of a week-long ceasefire on 1 December, tanks and infantry have moved into the south, focusing on Khan Younis. The IDF said its troops had reached the heart of the city on Tuesday.\nJoe Biden and his top officials had called on Israel to conduct the campaign in the south in a fundamentally different way from the north, with far more attention paid to avoiding civilian casualties, as the Gaza death toll passed 16,000 according to figures issued by the Hamas media office.\nThe US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, pointed to an IDF plan to split Gaza into small districts and warn residents of impending military operations in their districts, as a \u201cquite unusual step for a modern military\u201d to avoid civilian deaths. But amid fighting that the IDF said has been the most intense of the ground offensive so far, the civilian toll has remained very high.\nUS officials said on Monday it was too early to draw conclusions about the conduct of the war in southern Gaza, but Griffiths said it was already clear there had been no improvement and that US diplomatic efforts to influence the IDF had failed.\n\u201cThe way in which the military operation in the south has been carried out is very similar to what we saw in the north,\u201d he said. \u201cUS diplomacy was very much focused on this and [secretary of state] Tony Blinken spoke about it publicly. It does not seem to have worked at all, and so the pace of destruction in the south is as relentless as we see in the north.\n\u201cAnd so we\u2019re left doing very, very little, and frankly facing the inescapable truth which is this is no longer a humanitarian operation, trying to save lives for the people of Gaza. We\u2019ll stay. We\u2019re not leaving \u2026 but please don\u2019t think that the humanitarians can save the day. They can\u2019t.\u201d\nSpeaking in el-Arish, near Egypt\u2019s border with Gaza, the administrator of the US Agency for International Development, Samantha Power, said that civilian toll remained a primary concern for the Biden administration.\n\u201cFirst, as Israel\u2019s military operations continue, Palestinian civilians must be protected,\u201d Power told journalists after overseeing the delivery of 36,000 (16,330 kg) of US humanitarian relief supplies.\n\u201cFar too many innocent civilians have been killed. Some parents in Gaza are writing names on their children\u2019s legs, so that they can be identified if they or their families are killed. Other parents are having their children split up, sheltering at different locations, putting them with different relatives, so as to increase the chances that at least some of them will survive. No parent should ever have to make choices like that. Military operations need to be conducted in a way that distinguishes fighters from civilians.\u201d\nThe UN had sent the coordinates of UN schools and other institutions to the IDF and Hamas, identifying them as havens for civilians, but Griffiths echoed the comments of other UN officials this week, that there was no longer anywhere safe for Palestinians to take shelter in Gaza.\nGriffiths said: \u201cI had a 10-point plan last week \u2013 it makes me embarrassed to even think about it now \u2013 as to how we would respond when people came south. There\u2019s no 10-point plan any more because it\u2019s dependent on a certain number of deconfliction institutions being safe for people to live in. They don\u2019t exist.\u201d\nHe said that with no safe havens for civilians to gather, there was nowhere where aid could be delivered and distributed. About 100 trucks of humanitarian supplies have been crossing into Gaza daily since the weekend, but Griffiths said it was no longer possible for workers to reach the crossing point at Rafah to unload them or distribute the aid anywhere else on the Gaza Strip.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a logic to this, which is horrific and tragic and frankly apocalyptic,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t think of a better way to create a generation of anger and extremism than this.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018Apocalyptic\u2019 conditions in southern Gaza blocking aid, top UN official says", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/05/un-martin-griffiths-idf-campaign-southern-gaza-apocalyptic-conditions"}
