This created challenges for manufacturers due to lockdowns and restrictions.\nNevertheless, the connectors industry demonstrated resilience and adaptability. There was an increase in demand for connectors used in healthcare and medical equipment, as well as for data centers and telecommunication infrastructure.\nThe surge in remote work and reliance on digital technologies further amplified the need for connectors supporting these applications.\nThe PCB connectors segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period\nBased on product, the PCB connectors segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for more than one-fourth of the global connectors market revenue and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period, owing to the growth of the electronics industry along with advances in semiconductor technology. Increased demand for automotive electronics is expected to drive the market during the forecast period. However, the patchcord segment is projected to attain the highest CAGR of 10.2% from 2023 to 2032, due to increase in demand for rapid data transmission in sectors such as telecommunications, data centers, and cloud computing, which propels the adoption of advanced patchcord technologies.\nThe automotive segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period\nBased on end user, the automotive segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for nearly one-fourth of the global connector industry revenue and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period, owing to increase in demand for automotive safety systems which has a direct influence on the demand for automotive connectors. However, the telecom segment is projected to attain the highest CAGR of 8.3% from 2023 to 2032.\nThe copper segment to maintain its lead position during the forecast period\nBased on material, the copper segment accounted for the largest share in 2022, contributing to nearly one-third of the global connectors market revenue, due to their exceptional electrical conductivity, have experienced a surge in adoption with the increasing demand for high-speed data transmission across industries. However, the others segment is expected to portray the largest CAGR of 10.4% from 2023 to 2032 and is projected to maintain its lead position during the forecast period. This is owing to the use of brass, titanium, nickel, and gold materials in connectors presents a wide array of opportunities, enhancing connectivity solutions for a diverse range of industries and end users.\nGet Customized Reports with your Requirements:\nhttps://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-for-customization/10984?reqfor=covid\nAsia-Pacific to maintain its dominance by 2031\nBased on region, Asia-Pacific held the highest market share in terms of revenue in 2022, accounting for more than two-fifths of the global connectors market revenue, owing to huge investment in infrastructure, energy, and technology development. The second largest economy of the world, China is preferred for setting up the manufacturing plants including Prysmian, one of the largest cable manufacturing companies of the world. However, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness the fastest CAGR of 8.4% from 2022 to 2031.\nKey Industry Development:\nAugust 2023 - Molex, a leading global connectivity and electronics solutions provider, has captured a prestigious IoT Product Award at the recent OFweek 2023 (8th) IoT / AI Conference recently hosted in Shenzhen, China .
