Her immediate family are Palestinian Christians from the West Bank, while she has extended family members in Gaza City. She has spoken about her family members being trapped in Gaza - and how she and her sister are trying to get news from their relatives every day as they run out of food and have been reduced to drinking water. Ms Moran's mother Randa is Palestinian while her father James is British. He joined the EU Commission when she was one and the family moved to Brussels. Her mother's family are originally Greek but they moved to Palestine and then Jordan after the diaspora in the 60s. Her great-grandfather was the Palestinian writer Wasif Jawhariyyeh, who wrote memoirs about Palestinian life under Ottoman and British rule.

There were no leaflets dropped, there was no prior warning \u2013 nothing. We are terrified for them, we don't know if they are going to last until Christmas.'\nThey had been given no warning and were killed as they were walking towards a convent 'inside the premises of the Parish, where there are no belligerents,' the church said. It added that seven more people were shot and wounded yesterday as they 'tried to protect others inside the church compound'.\nChristian families have been sheltering in the complex since the war erupted, with members of Ms Moran's extended family - a grandmother, her son, his wife and their 11-year-old twins - among the dozens taking refuge as battles rage outside.\nMs Moran said her family have been staying on mattresses along with dozens of others in the Catholic church for more than 60 days.\nA sixth member of her extended family in Gaza City - a grandfather - reportedly died last month after he was unable to reach hospital for medical treatment.\n'I'm now no longer sure they are going to survive until Christmas,' Ms Moran, who has been in contact with her family over the weeks, told the BBC yesterday.\nThe British-Palestinian MP has been sharing regular updates about the dire situation on social media.\nOn Sunday, she said she had been told that 'a tank has taken position outside the church and the building opposite has been taken. The people inside have died.\n'There are snipers at every window pointing into the church. Still shooting anyone emerging from buildings to use eg toilets. Still no food or water.'\nShe said earlier this week that her relatives had told her that two men - a janitor and bin collector - were killed by gunmen as they walked to and from the building.\nTerrified of being killed themselves, people inside the church have reportedly been unable to collect the bodies, which have remained decaying in the street for days.\nI am desperately worried for my extended family in Gaza City.\nThey have no electricity, no water, no food, and now a sniper is inside the Church compound where they are sheltering.\nMy family are not collateral damage.
