The West Bank had already experienced the highest levels of unrest in decades during the 18 months preceding the 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel by Hamas gunmen but confrontations have risen sharply as Israeli forces have launched an invasion of Gaza, Reuters reports.\nUpdated at 22.20 CET\n8 Jan 2024 00.46 CET Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz has confirmed that Israel was behind the killing of Hezbollah commander Wissam Hassan al Tawil, as already announced by the militant group. \u201cRegarding the elimination in southern Lebanon, we took responsibility for it. It\u2019s part of the war - we hit Hezbollah terrorists, infrastructures, and systems they placed in order to deter Israel,\u201d Katz said according to Israeli news site Ynet.\n8 Jan 2024 00.18 CET The Pentagon has said it is not currently planning to withdraw its roughly 2,500 troops from Iraq, despite Baghdad\u2019s announcement last week it would begin the process of removing the US-led military coalition from the country, Reuters reports. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not aware of any plans [for withdrawal]. We continue to remain very focused on the defeat Isis mission,\u201d air force Major Gen Patrick Ryder told a news briefing, using an acronym for Islamic State. He added that US forces are in Iraq at the invitation of its government. Ryder said he was also unaware of any notification by Baghdad to the Department of Defense about a decision to remove US troops, and referred reporters to the US state department for any diplomatic discussions on the matter. Prime minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani\u2019s office announced on Friday the moves to evict US forces following a US drone strike in Baghdad that was condemned by the government. The Pentagon said the strike killed a militia leader responsible for recent attacks on US personnel.

This is Helen Livingstone taking over from my colleague L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong.\n8 Jan 2024 23.46 CET Israeli leaders plan to tell the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, that the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza is contingent on progress on a deal to release the remaining Israeli hostages in the territory, according to a report. As we reported earlier, Blinken has landed in Tel Aviv ahead of potentially difficult meetings with Israeli leaders and officials on Tuesday. During their meetings, Israeli leaders will say they will only consider allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza if there is progress on the effort to return the Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, the Times of Israel said a Walla news report said. On his fourth trip to the Middle East in three months, Blinken will try to convince Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to begin serious negotiations on postwar governance in Gaza, to do more to protect civilians in Gaza, and to allow more aid into the territory.\nUpdated at 23.47 CET\n8 Jan 2024 23.00 CET The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they have located a cluster of weapons factories and tunnels used by Hamas militants in Gaza to manufacture rockets. IDF forces took a group of reporters on Monday to visit a site in Bureij in the central Gaza Strip which they said housed the largest weapons production site so far found in the territory. It said that in addition to long-range missiles, the underground workshops produced copies or adaptations of standard munitions such as mortar shells and were connected through underground shafts to a tunnel network used to transport the weapons to fighting units throughout the Gaza Strip, Reuters reported. An IDF spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, said the factory had been built around Salah al-Din Road, a major north-south route also used to transport humanitarian aid. He said Israeli troops \u201cfound, dismantled and are now destroying these facilities\u201d.\nUpdated at 23.07 CET\n8 Jan 2024 22.28 CET Israel\u2019s supreme court has rejected a request from international media organisations to allow journalists to report in Gaza. The Foreign Press Association, which represents dozens of media organisations operating in Israel and the Palestinian territories, filed a petition last month to order Israeli authorities to allow journalists to enter. Prior to 7 October, reporters with an Israeli-issued press card could enter Gaza and apply for an additional reporting permit from Hamas, which governs the territory. In its ruling, the Israeli court said that while it recognises the right of freedom of the press, the current wartime circumstances justify the restrictions. It said journalists inside Gaza could endanger soldiers by reporting about troop positions, AP reported. It said journalists could continue to enter Gaza under Israeli military escort.\nUpdated at 22.30 CET\n8 Jan 2024 22.09 CET Blinken arrives in Israel The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has arrived in Tel Aviv ahead of talks with Israeli officials on Tuesday. Blinken landed in Israel after meeting with the leaders of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as part of his fourth Middle East tour since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October. Before leaving Al Ula after meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Blinken said: We agreed to work together and coordinate our efforts to help Gaza stabilise and recover ... and to work toward long term peace and security and stability.

The West Bank had already experienced the highest levels of unrest in decades during the 18 months preceding the 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel by Hamas gunmen but confrontations have risen sharply as Israeli forces have launched an invasion of Gaza, Reuters reports.\nUpdated at 22.20 CET\n8 Jan 2024 19.58 CET The only hospital remaining in central Gaza is on the verge of shutting down amid intense fighting that has engulfed the area, a UN spokesperson has said. As we reported earlier, aid groups have been forced to withdraw from Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah in recent days, spreading panic among people sheltering there. The Israeli military has dropped leaflets designating areas surrounding the hospital as a \u201cred zone\u201d, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) said. Al-Aqsa is \u201cthe single remaining hospital in the middle area of Gaza\u201d, where a \u201cmajor offensive is under way\u201d, Gemma Connell, a spokesperson for the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA) told the BBC. The situation in the hospital is dire. We have just a single doctor who is working in the emergency room. You have only two surgeons left responding to hundreds of needs in that hospital. You have so many casualties coming in every single hour who are in desperate need of life-saving support. World Health Organization (WHO) staff who visited the medical facility on Sunday saw \u201csickening scenes of people of all ages being treated on blood-streaked floors and in chaotic corridors\u201d, the WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a statement.\nUpdated at 20.01 CET", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Three Palestinians shot dead by Israeli forces in West Bank, says health ministry", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jan/08/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-war-gaza-palestine-hamas-antony-blinken-meeting-saudi-prince-qatar"}
