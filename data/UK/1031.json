Commercial aircraft is expected to remain the largest and fastest-growing aircraft type in the market during the forecast period. The expected increase in the production rate of key aircraft programs, such as the A320 and B737, the return in service of the B737Max, the expected entry of new aircraft programs (C919, B777x, and MC-21), and rising aircraft fleet size are key factors driving the demand for the segments' growth.\nBased on the application type - The market is segmented into airframe, control surfaces, interior, engine, and others. Airframe is expected to remain the dominant as well as the fastest-growing application type in the market during the forecast period. The airframe is the largest structure in the aircraft, where blind bolts are used in a wide array of applications, including wings and fuselage, leading to its dominance in the market.\nBased on the material type - The market is segmented into titanium, aluminum, steel, and others. Titanium is expected to remain the most dominant material type in the market during the forecast period and is also expected to witness the highest growth during the same period. There has been an incessant replacement of steel and other heavy metal-based blind bolts with titanium blind bolts, owing to their excellent performance at a relatively low weight.\nBased on the blind-bolt type - The market is segmented into drive-nut bolts and pull-type bolts. Drive-nut bolt is expected to remain the dominant blind bolt type in the market during the forecast period, driven by their advantages such as accessibility, installation efficiency, vibration resistance, weight savings, load-bearing capacity, and versatility.\nTo know the attractive segments, click here for a free sample pdf:\nhttps://www.stratviewresearch.com/Request-Sample/460/Aircraft-Blind-Bolts-Market.html#form\nWhich Region Offers the Best Opportunity and Growth?\nThe report suggests that North America is expected to remain the largest market for Aircraft Blind Bolts during the forecast period. This growth is majorly attributed to the following \u2013\n- The USA is the growth engine of the region's market with the presence of major aircraft OEMs, tier players, blind bolt suppliers, and end-users.\n- All the major blind bolt manufacturers have their presence in the region to address the emergent needs of the OEMs to be the partners for their upcoming aircraft programs or upcoming fuel-efficient variants of existing aircraft programs.\nLikewise, the Asia-Pacific is expected to experience the highest growth in the market during the forecast period, The highest growth of Asia-Pacific is mainly attributable to the increasing aircraft fleet to support rising passenger traffic; the opening of assembly plants of Boeing and Airbus; the increasing procurement of military aircraft owing to the rising defense budget; and the upcoming indigenous aircraft (C919).\nAircraft Blind Bolts Market Drivers\nSome of the key reasons that are propelling the growth of the market include-\nOrganic growth of the aircraft industry coupled with an increase in the production rates of the key aircraft programs, including the A320neo, B737 Max, A220, B787, and A350XWB.\nThe introduction of new aircraft programs (C919, MC-21, B777x, etc.).\nAn increase in the preference for blind fasteners over traditional fasteners.\nThe development of lightweight and corrosion-resistant blind bolts.\nRising global aircraft fleet size.\nFor Customization or Any Other Queries, Get in Touch with Our Industry Experts- at sales@stratviewresearch.com\nTop 5 Companies in the Aircraft Blind Bolts Market?\nThe market is highly concentrated, with the presence of some regional and global players.
