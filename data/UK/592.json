Commercial aircraft is projected to remain the largest and fastest-growing segment of the aerospace composite ducting market during the forecast period, driven by the ungrounding of the B737 Max, the ramp-up of Airbus A320 family monthly production, and the development of high-thrust engines. A continuous shift from metal ducts to composite ducts in both low-pressure and high-pressure applications is another key factor giving a thrust to the segment's market.\nBased on the Reinforcement Type - The market has been segmented as glass fiber composites, carbon fiber composites, and other composites. Glass fiber is the most widely used reinforcement type in the market and is expected to remain the largest reinforcement type over the next five years. This fiber type is highly preferred in low-pressure applications, such as cabin air recirculation and cabin sidewall riser as it offers good mechanical performance at a relatively lower cost. Epoxy, phenolic, and thermoplastic resins are used along with glass fibers to manufacture ducting. Carbon fiber is likely to witness the highest growth over the next five years.\nBased on the Duct Type- The market has been segmented into high-pressure ducts and low-pressure ducts. The high-pressure ducting is likely to remain the fastest-growing duct type during the forecast period. Low-pressure applications dominate the global aerospace composite ducting market. Composite ducting is widely preferred in low-pressure applications throughout the entire breadth of fixed and rotary-wing aircraft types and offers several advantages, such as being lightweight, excellent strength, thermal resistance, and the ability to mold complex shapes.\nTo know the attractive segments, click here for a free sample pdf:\nhttps://www.stratviewresearch.com/Request-Sample/244/aerospace-and-defense-composite-ducting-market.html#form\nWhich Region Offers the Best Opportunity and Growth?\nThe report suggests that North America is expected to remain the largest market for aerospace composite ducting assemblies over the next five years. This growth is majorly attributed to the following \u2013\nThe region is the manufacturing capital of the aerospace industry with the presence of several major players, such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Bombardier, and the presence of major composite ducting manufacturers.\nLikewise, the Asia-Pacific is likely to experience the highest growth in the coming five years, driven by the commencement of commercial and regional aircraft manufacturing in China and Japan, upcoming indigenous aircraft, C919, and increasing defense spending.\nAerospace Composite Ducting Market Drivers\nSome of the key drivers listed in the report are given below.\nThe increasing adoption of composite ducts in low-pressure applications.\nThe market entry of upcoming aircraft platforms (B777x and C919)\nIn addition, rebounding aircraft production rates (B737 Max, A320 neo family, B787, and A350XWB)\nFor Customization or Any Other Queries, Get in Touch with Our Industry Experts at sales@stratviewresearch.com\nTop Companies in the Aerospace Composite Ducting Market?\nThe market is fairly consolidated with the presence of some global and regional players.
