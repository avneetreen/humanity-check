Our live coverage will resume later today. Here\u2019s a roundup of the latest developments. And you can see all our Israel-Gaza war coverage here. Thanks for reading. Israeli strikes killed 90 Palestinians in Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza on Sunday, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said. Videos posted online of what appeared to be the aftermath showed Palestinians digging through the rubble for survivors with shovels and their bare hands.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is \u201cappalled\u201d after Israel\u2019s deadly raid on northern Gaza\u2019s Kamal Adwan hospital at the weekend. WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus said the \u201ceffective destruction\u201d of the hospital over the past several days was \u201crendering it non-functional and resulting in the death of at least eight patients\u201d.\nThe Israeli army has said it uncovered the biggest Hamas tunnel in the Gaza Strip so far, just a few hundred metres from a key border crossing. Such was its size that small vehicles would be able to travel within it, an AFP photographer granted access to it reported. The underground passage formed part of a wider branching network that stretched for more than 2.5 miles (4km) and came within 400 metres of the Erez border crossing, the army said. It would have cost millions of dollars and taken years to construct, Israeli forces said.\nThe United Nations security council could vote as early as Monday on a proposal to demand that Israel and Hamas allow aid access to Gaza \u2013 via land, sea and air routes \u2013 and set up UN monitoring of the humanitarian assistance delivered. Diplomats said the fate of the draft security council resolution hinges on final negotiations between Israel ally the US, which has council veto power, and the United Arab Emirates, which has drafted the text.\nThe Syrian army has said Israeli missiles launched from the occupied Golan Heights hit sites near Damascus that regional intelligences say targeted Iranian militias\u2019 stronghold near Syria\u2019s holiest Shia Muslim shrine. Syria\u2019s air defences shot down some of the missiles that targeted the countryside around the capital in an incident that injured two soldiers, the army said in a statement on Sunday.\nThe Palestinian health ministry in the occupied West Bank is calling for an international investigation into reports that Israeli forces buried Palestinians alive in the courtyard of Gaza\u2019s Kamal Adwan hospital via bulldozers amid its deadly raid over the weekend. Palestinian health minister Mai Alkaila cited reports from witnesses who said they saw Israeli forces burying Palestinians alive in the courtyard of one of the few remaining functioning hospitals in Gaza, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. The Guardian could not confirm the reports and Israel had not responded to them.\nThe Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza opened on Sunday for aid trucks for the first time since the outbreak of war, officials said, in a move intended to double the amount of food and medicine reaching the territory. Two sources in the Egyptian Red Crescent said trucks had crossed Kerem Shalom on Sunday on their way into Gaza. One said there were 79 trucks.\nFrance said that one of its workers was killed by an Israeli attack in Rafah, Reuters reports. According to French foreign minister Catherine Colonna, who spoke to journalists following a visit to Israel and the West Bank, the man who was killed was a Palestinian national who worked for the French Institute for decades.\nThe director of Israeli spy agency Mossad has met the Qatari prime minister for talks on resuming indirect negotiations on the release of hostages , CNN has reported, quoting diplomatic sources. The sources said the meeting on Friday between David Barnea and Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani was positive, the network said. Reuters has quoted two Egyptian security sources as saying Israel and Hamas are both open to a renewed deal involving a ceasefire and hostage release, although disagreements on detail remain. They said Hamas was insisting on setting the list of hostages to be released unilaterally and demanding Israel withdraw its forces behind pre-determined lines.\nFormer UK defence secretary Ben Wallace has warned Israel that it risks undermining the legal basis for its action in the Gaza Strip , adding to growing international pressure over the escalating conflict. Writing for Britain\u2019s Telegraph, the senior Tory warned against a \u201ckilling rage\u201d and said Israel\u2019s \u201coriginal legal authority of self-defence is being undermined by its own actions\u201d.\nThe US is to announce the launch of an expanded maritime protection force involving Arab states to combat the increasingly frequent Houthi attacks being mounted from Yemen\u2019s ports on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The force is due to be announced by the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, during his Middle East visit. Five big shipping companies have now stopped their ships using the Red Sea in the wake of attacks mounted by Houthis in protest at Israel\u2019s efforts to eliminate Hamas in Gaza.\nThe head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has said of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza: \u201cBy any account, I haven\u2019t seen anything of this scale.\u201d Philippe Lazzarini went on to say in an interview with Al Jazeera: \u201cEverything is absolutely unprecedented and staggering. The number of people who have been killed \u2026 in 40 days, more women and children killed than the number of civilians in the Ukraine war.\u201d\nUpdated at 04.02 CET\n18 Dec 2023 03.24 CET The director of Israeli spy agency Mossad has met the Qatari prime minister for talks on resuming indirect negotiations on the release of hostages, CNN has reported, quoting diplomatic sources. The sources said the meeting on Friday between David Barnea and Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani was positive, the network said. CNN\u2019s report continues: The meeting comes after another trip Barnea was meant to make to Doha was cancelled earlier in the week by the Israeli government. This latest meeting was planned before the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) accidentally killed three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Friday, but that incident has added urgency to the conversations, the source said. On Thursday an Israeli official told CNN that the war cabinet felt \u201cconditions are not right\u201d to try to restart the talks. Qatar and the US have been working to try to resurrect the negotiations, with new proposals made to free more of the more than 100 hostages in Gaza. As we reported earlier, Israel and Hamas are both open to a renewed deal involving a ceasefire and hostage release, although disagreements on detail remain, according to two Egyptian security sources. Reuters said that according to the sources, Hamas is insisting on setting the list of hostages to be released unilaterally and demanding Israel withdraw its forces behind pre-determined lines.\nIsrael agreed on Hamas deciding the list and has asked for a timeline and to review the list in order to decide on ceasefire\u2019s time and duration, the sources said. However, Israel has refused to withdraw, they said.\n18 Dec 2023 02.59 CET Israel's 'killing rage' risks undermining legality of Gaza offensive, says Ben Wallace Former UK defence secretary Ben Wallace has warned Israel that it risks undermining the legal basis for its action in the Gaza Strip, adding to growing international pressure over the escalating conflict. Writing for Britain\u2019s Telegraph, the senior Tory warned against a \u201ckilling rage\u201d and said Israel\u2019s \u201coriginal legal authority of self-defence is being undermined by its own actions\u201d. PA Media reports that intervention by Wallace, who left office earlier this year, is the latest warning to Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government amid deepening concern over the scale of civilian casualties. View image in fullscreen Former British defence secretary Ben Wallace says Israel \u2018needs to stop this crude and indiscriminate method of attack\u2019. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images It comes after the British foreign secretary, David Cameron, called for a \u201csustainable ceasefire\u201d as he warned that \u201ctoo many civilians have been killed\u201d in a joint article with his German counterpart in the Sunday Times. Wallace warned: Netanyahu\u2019s mistake was to miss the [Hamas] attack in the first place. But if he thinks a killing rage will rectify matters, then he is very wrong. His methods will not solve this problem. In fact, I believe his tactics will fuel the conflict for another 50 years. Wallace said he was not \u201ccalling for a ceasefire with Hamas\u201d but instead that Israel \u201cneeds to stop this crude and indiscriminate method of attack\u201d.\nUpdated at 03.01 CET\n18 Dec 2023 02.32 CET In case you missed this earlier, the US is to announce the launch of an expanded maritime protection force involving Arab states to combat the increasingly frequent Houthi attacks being mounted from Yemen\u2019s ports on commercial shipping in the Red Sea, Patrick Wintour reports. The force, provisionally entitled Operation Prosperity Guardian, is due to be announced by the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, when he visits the Middle East. Much like the Task Force 153 already operating out of Bahrain, the larger protection force is designed to provide reassurance to commercial shipping companies that Houthi attacks will be seen off, and that the sea remains safe for commercial shipping. Five big shipping companies have now stopped their ships using the Red Sea in the wake of attacks mounted by Houthis in protest against Israel\u2019s efforts to eliminate Hamas in Gaza.

The crossing was closed after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack and aid was being delivered solely through Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing with Egypt, which Israel said could only accommodate the entry of 100 trucks a day. Reuters reports that Kerem Shalom, on the border of Egypt, Israel and Gaza, is one of the main transit points for goods in and out of the Palestinian territory, allowing much faster transit than the Rafah passenger crossing a few kilometres away. Israel approved the entry of aid last week. Cogat, the branch of military that coordinates humanitarian aid with the Palestinian territories, said in a statement: Starting today [Sunday], UN aid trucks will undergo security checks and be transferred directly to Gaza via Kerem Shalom, to abide by our agreement with the US. Asked if aid had crossed into Gaza, an Israeli official said yes. View image in fullscreen A humanitarian aid truck is inspected at the Kerem Shalom crossing, seen in footage released last week. Photograph: Cogat/X/Reuters A Palestinian border official confirmed Kerem Shalom was reopened earlier on Sunday in coordination with the UN Palestinian refugee agency and Israel. Part of the aid had arrived in Gaza by Sunday night, while the rest would be completed on Monday, the official said. Two sources in the Egypt Red Crescent said trucks had crossed Kerem Shalom on Sunday on their way into Gaza. One said there were 79 trucks. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office has previously said the opening would allow Israel to maintain its commitments to permit the entry of 200 aid trucks a day, agreed on in the hostage deal brokered and implemented last month. As Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has gathered pace, the humanitarian situation in Gaza has worsened dramatically, with the UN and other world bodies warning of severe shortages of food, clean water and medicines.\n18 Dec 2023 01.48 CET UN security council moves towards vote on Gaza aid access The United Nations security council could vote as early as Monday on a proposal to demand that Israel and Hamas allow aid access to Gaza \u2013 via land, sea and air routes \u2013 and set up UN monitoring of the humanitarian assistance delivered, Reuters reports. Diplomats said the fate of the draft security council resolution hinges on final negotiations between Israel ally the US, which has council veto power, and the United Arab Emirates, which has drafted the text. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: We have engaged constructively and transparently throughout the entire process in an effort to unite around a product that will pass. The UAE knows exactly what can pass and what cannot. It is up to them if they want to get this done. The US wants to tone down language on a cessation of hostilities, diplomats said. The draft text, seen by Reuters, currently \u201ccalls for an urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access\u201d. View image in fullscreen The UN general assembly in New York. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images UN officials and aid agencies warn of a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, including mass starvation and disease, with the majority of the Palestinian territory\u2019s 2.3 million people driven from their homes during the two-month-long conflict. A council resolution needs at least nine votes in favour and no vetoes by the US, China, the UK, France or Russia. Earlier this month, Washington vetoed a resolution in the 15-member council that would have demanded an immediate humanitarian ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The 193-member UN general assembly then demanded a ceasefire last week, with 153 states voting in favour.\n18 Dec 2023 01.28 CET On the Israeli army saying it has uncovered the biggest Hamas tunnel in the Gaza Strip so far, such was its size that small vehicles could drive in the tunnel, it has been reported. The army said the tunnel was uncovered near a key border crossing and that it formed part of a wider branching network underground that stretched for more than 4km (2.5 miles). The tunnel would have cost millions of dollars and taken years to construct, and the project was led by Mohamed Yahya, the brother of the Hamas chief, Yahya Sinwar, according to Israeli forces. The passage came within 400 metres of northern Gaza\u2019s Erez border with Israel.

Photograph: Amir Cohen/Reuters The honeycomb of passageways features drainage and sewage systems, electricity, ventilation and a communication network as well as rails. The floor is compacted earth, the walls are reinforced concrete and the entrance is a metal cylinder with 1.5cm thick walls. The army said it had found a large number of weapons stored in the tunnel. The labyrinth of tunnels beneath Gaza, which the Israeli military has nicknamed the \u201cGaza Metro\u201d, was initially devised as a way of circumventing the crushing Israeli-Egyptian blockade, in place since 2007.

After a UN visit to deliver medicines and surgical supplies, the team described the emergency department in the territory\u2019s main health facility as resembling a \u201cbloodbath\u201d, Reuters reports. The WHO said on Sunday there were hundreds of wounded patients at the Gaza City hospital, with new ones arriving by the minute and trauma injuries being stitched on the floor, with almost no pain management available. Only four hospitals of 24 working in north Gaza before the war with Israel began have even partial service, and three of those are barely functioning, the WHO said.

Photograph: AFP/Getty Images It said it was urgently gathering information at the Kamal Adwan hospital, where Gazan authorities said Israeli forces this week used a bulldozer to smash through the perimeter of a site Israel has said was used by Hamas fighters. The militant group, which governs Gaza, has denied using the Kamal Adwan or other hospitals for its activities. Israel has also said al-Shifa, which it had occupied earlier in the war, had been used by Hamas. Tens of thousands of Palestinians are believed to remain in north Gaza, after Israelis forces pushed most of the population to the south during the first days of the bombing campaign and ground war after Hamas\u2019s bloody 7 October attack on southern Israel.\nUpdated at 01.09 CET\n17 Dec 2023 00.40 CET Israeli missiles hit sites near Damascus, says Syria The Syrian army has said Israeli missiles launched from the occupied Golan Heights hit sites near Damascus that regional intelligences say targeted Iranian militias\u2019 stronghold near Syria\u2019s holiest Shia Muslim shrine. Reuters reports Syria\u2019s air defences shot down some of the missiles that targeted the countryside around the capital in an incident that injured two soldiers, the army said in a statement on Sunday. It did not give any details on the location of the incident. Since Hamas\u2019s deadly 7 October attack, Israel has escalated its strikes on Iranian-backed militia targets in Syria and also struck Syrian army air defences and some Syrian forces. The Israel Defence Force did not immediately comment on the attack. View image in fullscreen Israeli soldiers training in the occupied Golan Heights this month. Photograph: Gil Eliyahu/Reuters Two regional intelligence sources said the strikes hit an outpost of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah group in the Sayeda Zainab neighourhood of southern Damascus, the site of Syria\u2019s holiest major Shia shrine. They say its main headquarters are in that neighbourhood, where it has a heavy presence and a string of underground bases. The area has attracted thousands of pro-Iranian militia fighters from Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan who came into Syria to fight alongside Syrian president Bashar al-Assad\u2019s troops.

It added that since 21 October, 4,367 aid trucks have entered the strip through the Rafah crossing, 60% of which were for the PRCS. It went on to call for \u201cunconditional continued aid entry\u201d into Gaza where more than 1.7 million Palestinians have been displaced as a result Israel\u2019s attacks across the strip.\nUpdated at 00.56 CET\n17 Dec 2023 00.01 CET Palestinian health ministry calls for international investigation into reports of Israeli forces burying Palestinians alive at Kamal Adwan hospital The Palestinian health ministry in the occupied West Bank is calling for an international investigation into reports that Israeli forces buried Palestinians alive in the courtyard of Gaza\u2019s Kamal Adwan hospital via bulldozers amid its deadly raid over the weekend. Palestine\u2019s health minister Mai Alkaila cited reports from witnesses who said they saw Israeli forces burying Palestinians alive in the courtyard of one of the few remaining functioning hospitals in Gaza, Palestinian news agency WAFA reports. Alkaila also urged the international comunity to \u201cnot ignore or remain silent about reports of war crimes coming from the Gaza strip\u201d, WAFA added. Writing on Twitter/X, the Palestinian foreign ministry also called for an \u201cimmediate international investigation into the initial reports that the occupation committed heinous and horrific crimes in the courtyard of Kamal Adwan hospital\u201d.

Who could do that? All those who committed this crime should be brought to justice and taken to the international criminal court.\u201d Geneva-based Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor also called for an independent investigation into the reports, citing witnesses who said that Israeli bulldozers buried Palestinians alive and that least one of the bodies could be seen amid sand piles. The World Health Organization has said that it is \u201cappalled by the effective destruction\u201d of the hospital, adding that \u201cGaza\u2019s health system was already on its knees and the loss of another even minimally functioning hospital is a severe blow.\u201d The Guardian could not confirm the Palestinian reports. Israel has not responded to them.\nUpdated at 00.55 CET\n17 Dec 2023 23.30 CET France said that one of its workers was killed by an Israeli attack in Rafah, Reuters reports. According to French foreign minister Catherine Colonna, who spoke to journalists following a visit to Israel and the West Bank, the man who was killed was a Palestinian national who worked for the French Institute for decades. The French foreign ministry said earlier that the man was seeking refuge in the house of a colleague from the French consulate along with two other co-workers and several family members, Reuters reports. \u201cThe house was hit by an Israeli air strike on Wednesday evening, which seriously hurt our agent and killed about 10 others,\u201d the ministry said. According to the ministry, the man later died from his wounds by the Israeli strike. It did not provide a date. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked for explanations as to why the house ... had been hit,\u201d Colonna told reporters.\nUpdated at 23.35 CET\n17 Dec 2023 23.12 CET Brother of Israeli hostage accidentally killed by IDF says army 'murdered' him The brother of Alon Shamriz, a 26-year-old Israeli hostage who was accidentally killed by the Israel Defense Forces and buried on Sunday, said that the Israeli army \u201cabandoned\u201d and \u201cmurdered\u201d him. Agence France-Presse reports: Alon Shamriz, 26, was one of the three Israeli hostages shot dead by soldiers during an operation in the Gaza City suburb of Shejaiya, even as they carried a white flag and cried for help in Hebrew. Shamriz, Yotam Haim and Samer Al-Talalqa were killed when troops mistook them for a threat and opened fire, the army said. \u2018Those who abandoned you also murdered you after all that you did right,\u2019 Ido, brother of Shamriz said at the funeral in kibbutz Shefayim north of Tel Aviv attended by dozens of relatives and family members. \u2018You survived 70 days in hell,\u2019 Shamriz\u2019s mother, Dikla, said in her eulogy. \u2018Another moment and you would have been in my arms.\u2019 Israeli media reported that Al-Talalqa was buried on Saturday, while the funeral for Haim was scheduled on Monday. The deaths of the three men, all in their twenties, have sparked protests in Tel Aviv as demonstrators demanded that the authorities offer a new plan for bringing home the remaining hostages held in the Gaza Strip.\nUpdated at 23.21 CET\n17 Dec 2023 22.23 CET Fears are growing of an all-out Israel-Hezbollah war as fighting escalates. The Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger reports: When the news first broke of the Hamas attack early on 7 October, Itai Reuveni and the other reservists in his paratrooper battalion packed their bags and arrived at their muster point well before their call-up came from the army. The paratroopers did not head south to Gaza but to the northern border, where they believed a far greater threat than Hamas was poised to join the fight: Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia movement backed by Tehran. \u2018We\u2019re here to make sure that no one does to us in the north what they did to us in the south,\u2019 said Reuveni, 40, a master sergeant who in his civilian life does thinktank research on terrorist financing. \u2018We understand that Hezbollah is much more sophisticated [than Hamas]. We understand it\u2019s not 3,000 fighters that come over the border, it will be much more, and you\u2019ll also have Iran in the equation. We are here to deal with that.\u2019 Reuveni is not alone in seeing Hezbollah as the greater danger to Israel. The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and other hawks in the cabinet argued for a pre-emptive strike against the militant group in the immediate aftermath of the 7 October attack. That caused alarm in Washington, fearful of a regional war that could pull Iran into the fight. With US backing, Benjamin Netanyahu fended off the proposal, but the conviction has taken hold among Israeli politicians, generals and a widening slice of the public that a new war in Lebanon is inevitable.
