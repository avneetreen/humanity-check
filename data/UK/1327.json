The prompt \u2018Palestine\u2019 returned an image of a hand holding a gun.\nOne WhatsApp user also shared screenshots showing a search for \u2018Palestinian\u2019 resulted in an image of a man with a gun.\nA source said employees at WhatsApp owner Meta have reported the issue and escalated it internally.\nWhatsApp\u2019s AI image generator, which is not yet available to all, allows users to create their own stickers \u2013 cartoon-style images of people and objects they can send in messages, similar to emojis.\nA search for \u2018Palestinian\u2019 generated an image of a man with a gun\nWhen used to search for \u2018Israel\u2019, the tool showed the Israeli flag and a man dancing, while explicitly military-related prompts such as \u2018Israel army\u2019 or \u2018Israeli defense forces\u2019 did not include any guns, only people in uniforms, including a soldier on a camel. Most were shown smiling, one was praying \u2013 but was flanked by swords.\nA search for \u2018Israeli boy\u2019 returned images of children smiling and playing football. \u2018Jewish boy Israeli\u2019 showed two boys wearing necklaces with the Star of David, one standing, and one reading while wearing a yarmulke.\nAddressing the issue, Meta spokesperson Kebin McAlister told the paper: \u2018As we said when we launched the feature, the models could return inaccurate or inappropriate outputs as with all generative AI systems.\n\u2018We\u2019ll continue to improve these features as they evolve and more people share their feedback.\u2019\nA search for theIsrael army did not return any guns\nIt is not the first time Meta has faced criticism over its products during the conflict.\nInstagram has been found to write \u2018Palestinian terrorist\u2019 when translating \u2018Palestinian\u2019 followed by the phrase \u2018Praise be to Allah\u2019 in Arabic posts. The company called it a \u2018glitch\u2019 and apologised.\nMany users have also reported having their content censored when posting in support of Palestinians, noting a significant drop in engagement.\nInstagram users complain of Palestine shadow bans As the Israel-Hamas war continues, many Instagram users have been \u2018reposting\u2019 content on their stories to inform their followers with information such as upcoming protests, petitions and letters to send to their MPs, writes Lucia Botfield. However, those expressing support for Palestine have witnessed a drastic drop in engagement \u2013 with up 98% fewer views seen in some cases. \u2018Every time I post about Palestine this happens, even a few years back,\u2019 said one user who has been affected by the algorithmic issue. To get around this, they said the only way was to \u2018share some personal content\u2019, as it \u2018tricks\u2019 Instagram into getting your views up again. Last year supermodel Bella Hadid shared that she has also been affected by the issue, known as \u2018shadow banning\u2019. \u2018My Instagram has disabled me from posting on my story \u2013 pretty much only when it is Palestine based I\u2019m going to assume,\u2019 she said. \u2018When I post about Palestine I get immediately shadow banned and almost 1 million less [sic] of you see my stories and posts.\u2019 Instagram stories supporting Palestine have been shown to receive lower views than other content Ms Hadid, whose father is Palestinian and was born in Nazareth, is a vocal supporter of the Free Palestine movement \u2013 and has reportedly suffered a loss of brand deals as a result. An investigation by Metro.co.uk verified that posts featuring pro-Palestine views received only a fraction of the views compared to normal, reposting on a number of occasions and generating the same result.\nIn a statement, Meta said that \u2018higher volumes of content being reported\u2019 during the conflict, \u2018content that doesn\u2019t violate our policies may be removed in error\u2019.\nA study commissioned by Meta into Facebook and Instagram found during attacks on Gaza in May 2021 its own policies \u2018appear to have had an adverse human rights impact \u2026 on the rights of Palestinian users to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, political participation, and non-discrimination, and therefore on the ability of Palestinians to share information and insights about their experiences as they occurred.\u2019\nMORE : Fake news spreads like wildfire after Israel attacks\nMORE : X under fire over spread of \u2018terrorist content and hate speech\u2019\nMORE : Bella Hadid finally speaks on Gaza and Israel terror attack: \u2018Forgive me for my silence\u2019", "source_domain": "metro.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "WhatsApp's AI has shocking ideas about Palestinian children", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2023/11/03/whatsapp-ai-creates-images-of-gun-wielding-boy-from-palestine-prompts-19768060/"}
