Hundreds of girls and boys are reportedly being killed or injured every day.\u201d\nEfforts at the UN security council to negotiate an agreed resolution calling for a ceasefire are deadlocked, with the 10 non-permanent members doing their best to reach an agreement on wording and emphasis. Pressure will then be applied to prevent one of the five veto-wielding permanent members, most likely the US or Russia, from blocking the text.\nIsrael has vowed to wipe out Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, after the militants killed 1,400 people and took more than 240 hostages in a string of attacks on 7 October. On Monday, the Israeli military said it had completely encircled Gaza City after more than a week of heavy fighting, in effect severing the territory into two.\nGuterres said that clear violations of international humanitarian law were being committed. He added that the UN needed $1.2bn (\u00a31bn) to help deliver aid to 2.7 million people in Gaza and the West Bank. In practice little of this aid can reach people inside Gaza.\n\u201cGround operations by the Israel Defense Forces and continued bombardment are hitting civilians, hospitals, refugee camps, mosques, churches and UN facilities, including shelters. No one is safe,\u201d Guterres told reporters.\n\u201cAt the same time, Hamas and other militants use civilians as human shields and continue to launch rockets indiscriminately towards Israel,\u201d he said.\nGuterres said 89 people working with the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) had been killed in Gaza, which he described as the highest toll for UN aid workers, higher \u201cthan in any comparable period in the history of our organisation\u201d.\nIn a phone call on Monday with Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the US president, Joe Biden, repeated calls to protect Palestinians, but there were few signs that US calls for restraint were being heard.\nAsked about civilian casualties on Monday, a White House spokesperson said: \u201cWe have seen some indications that there are efforts being applied in certain scenarios to try to minimise, but I don\u2019t want to overstate that.\u201d\nMeanwhile, aid has started to enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing in Egypt again, Gutteres said, but it was arriving at wholly inadequate rates.\n\u201cThe trickle of assistance does not meet the ocean of need,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cThe Rafah crossing alone does not have the capacity to process aid trucks at the scale required.\u201d\nHe said slightly more than 400 trucks had crossed into Gaza over the past two weeks \u2013 compared with 500 a day before the conflict began \u2013 representing an average of 28 trucks a day.\nThe UN last week said more than one border crossing was needed to deliver aid to Gaza, and that Kerem Shalom \u2013 controlled by Israel \u2013 was the only one equipped to take enough trucks. Israel has refused to open the crossing, saying it would represent a security risk.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Gaza becoming \u2018a graveyard for children\u2019, says UN secretary general", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/06/gaza-becoming-a-graveyard-for-children-says-un-secretary-general"}
