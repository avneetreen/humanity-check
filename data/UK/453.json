When the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, ordered a \u201ccomplete siege\u201d of the Gaza Strip after the Hamas attack, he said: \u201cI have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed\u2026 We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.\u201d More recently, in October, when Benjamin Netanyahu referred to the Palestinian people in the besieged Gaza Strip, he invoked the Amalek, a nation in the Hebrew Bible that the Israelites were ordered to wipe out in an act of revenge. \u201cYou must remember what Amalek has done to you,\u201d he said in a speech announcing the start of a ground invasion in Gaza, and added that Israeli soldiers were part of a chain that goes back 3,000 years. Genocide justified by religious fundamentalism.\nThere is no place for peace treaties here. Tzipi Hotovely, the Israeli ambassador to the UK, insisted in an interview with Sky News on 16 October that there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza: \u201cIsrael is in charge of the safety of Israelis; Hamas is in charge of the safety of the Palestinians.\u201d Of course, there is no humanitarian crisis among the Palestinians, since the Israeli high command apparently consider them to be not fully human. No wonder that, together with Netanyahu and other leading Israeli politicians, Hotovely resolutely rejects the two-state solution: \u201chuman animals\u201d don\u2019t deserve a state.\nA day before three Jewish hostages were mistakenly killed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza on 15 December, Netanyahu said: \u201cI say this in the face of great pain but also in the face of international pressures. Nothing will stop us.\u201d The addressees of this message are not only the relatives of the remaining hostages, who accuse the government of not doing enough to release the estimated 129 that remain in the Strip; the main addressees are perhaps foreign governments, including the US, that are exerting pressure on Israel to show more restraint. Netanyahu\u2019s ultimate message is: even without the support of its Western allies, nothing will stop Israel in achieving its goals (total annihilation of Hamas; rejection of the two-state solution).\nThe problem with this radical stance is that, as Hani al-Masri, the director-general of the Palestinian Centre for Policy Research and Strategic Studies, pointed out correctly, in pursuing them, Israel is \u201ca prisoner of its own unreachable goals\u201d. Why? Because, to use another quotation, as the anarchist and pacifist president of the Palestine branch of the War Resisters\u2019 International, Natan Hofshi, wrote back in 1946: \u201cWithout an understanding with our Arab neighbours, we are building on a volcano and our whole work is in jeopardy.\u201d\nSubscribe to the Saturday Read View all newsletters Your new guide to the best writing on ideas, politics, books and culture each weekend \u2013 from the New Statesman.

THANK YOU Close\nPeace will only emerge when Palestinians are allowed to organise themselves as a strong independent political force, broadly democratic and rejecting all forms of religious fundamentalism \u2013 something Israel is doing everything possible to prevent by giving Palestinians one choice: to accept Hamas as the only voice that is fighting for them. The latest opinion polls show that anger over the war is boosting Palestinian support for Hamas, particularly in the West Bank, where the IDF is not conducting an all-out offensive and where Hamas does not have control. Throughout the Arab world, hundreds of thousands are protesting against Israel, and tensions are reaching a point of explosion. Some on the left may see in such an explosion a moment of truth, when liberal-pacifist illusions about the occupation are upended \u2013 I see in it a catastrophe, not only for Jews and Palestinians but for the world.\n[See also: The fightback against US anti-Semitism has begun]\nNetanyahu\u2019s \u201cnothing will stop us\u201d speech echoes Vladimir Putin\u2019s statement the day before, on 14 December, in which the Russian president vowed to fight on in Ukraine until Moscow secures the country\u2019s \u201cdemilitarisation\u201d, \u201cdenazification\u201d and neutrality \u2013 unless Kyiv accepts a deal that achieves those goals. \u201cThere will be peace when we achieve our goals,\u201d Putin declared. \u201cAs for demilitarisation, if they [the Ukrainians] don\u2019t want to come to an agreement \u2013 well, then we are forced to take other measures, including military ones.\u201d Putin couldn\u2019t restrain himself from cynically remarking that Russia is demilitarising Ukraine by way of destroying hundreds of its tanks and guns \u2013 war is thus presented as the ultimate act of demilitarisation. But did some Western heads of state not make a similar point when, reacting to the desperate calls for a ceasefire in the Gaza conflict, they advocated a \u201csustainable ceasefire\u201d? Though their idea was a ceasefire that would lead to permanent peace, it ultimately amounts to the claim that the only \u201csustainable\u201d peace is that which follows a (military) victory.\nThe parallel between Israel-Palestine and Ukraine is imperfect: in the case of the Palestinians and their Israeli neighbours, a compromise between the two peoples is the only way out, while Ukraine is a victim of brutal aggression and has the full right to persevere until victory. Ukraine is now paying the price for exclusively choosing the side of the Western powers, ignoring the link between its struggle for independence with the developing world\u2019s decolonisation process, as well as suppressing its own political left as suspect, somehow associated with Russia. Now that Western states are sceptical about the extent to which they can continue to help Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s government, Ukraine may find itself in a desperate position.\nWe have to engage with the topic of decolonisation. The scholars Eve Tuck and K Wayne Yang are right when they insist that \u201cdecolonisation\u201d should not be used as a universal metaphor: \u201cDecolonisation brings about the repatriation of indigenous land and life; it is not a metaphor for other things we want to do to improve our societies and schools. The easy adoption of decolonising discourse by educational advocacy and scholarship, evidenced by the increasing number of calls to \u2018decolonise our schools\u2019, or use \u2018decolonising methods\u2019, or \u2018decolonise student thinking\u2019, turns decolonisation into a metaphor.\u201d Such a metaphoric universalisation blurs the actual violence of decolonisation. \u201cDecolonised thinking\u201d (done in a safe academic environment) is a poor substitute for the real and brutal struggle of the oppressed against their masters.\nWhat now overshadows this is the violence of Hamas, which was perceived by many as an attempt at actual decolonisation. However, this is where things get more problematic. First, it is all too easy to dismiss the state of Israel as a result of the colonisation of the Palestinian territory \u2013 I agree with Edward Said who thought that both Palestinians and Jews have a right to live there, and that they are condemned to live there together.\nI don\u2019t consider Hamas\u2019s stance \u201cleftist\u201d in any meaningful sense of the term, and I don\u2019t envisage a military defeat of Israel as a solution to the Middle East crisis. In a recent piece for Al Jazeera, Jamil Khader, a professor at Bethlehem University, condemns my \u201clofty aspirational vision\u201d as \u201ccompletely disconnected from the realities on the ground\u201d. What he finds \u201cincomprehensible\u201d is my insistence on \u201csome liberal politics of hope in this catastrophic context\u201d, like when I see a possible change coming through \u201cthe slow rise of solidarity between the Palestinian citizens of Israel and the Jews opposing the all-destructive war\u201d. As a pragmatic realist, I am well aware that such a solidarity is difficult to imagine today. But it is here that we should resuscitate the famous motto of the May 1968 protests in Paris: Soyons r\u00e9alistes, demandons l\u2019impossible. Be realistic, demand the impossible. The truly dangerous utopia is the idea that the solution to the Middle East crisis can only be achieved through military force.\nThe second point to address on the subject of decolonisation is that the reality of it often is a metaphor for another process. Recall numerous African countries, from Angola to Zimbabwe, where the overthrow of Western imperial control ended up with corrupted social orders in which the gap between the new masters and the poor has become greater than it was before independence. \u201cDecolonisation\u201d was thus a metaphor for (or one aspect of) the emergence of a new class society.\nSouth Africa today has the biggest gap between the poor and the rich \u2013 no wonder that a very depressing thing happened to me in July 2023. In a public debate at Birkbeck Summer School in London, a black woman from South Africa, a veteran activist for the African National Congress, which has ruled the country since 1994, said that the predominant stance among the poor black majority is now increasingly a nostalgia for apartheid. Back then, she said, that demographic\u2019s standard of living was, if anything, a little higher than it is today, and there was safety and security (South Africa was a police state, after all). While today, the woman explained, poverty is supplemented by violence and insecurity.\nIf a white person were to say this, they would be, of course, immediately accused of racism \u2013 but we should nonetheless think about it. If we don\u2019t do it, the new right will do it for us (as they are already doing, lambasting what they regard as the inability of South Africa\u2019s black citizens to run a country properly). The temptation to risk brutal \u201cdecolonisation\u201d irrespective of what follows should be resisted. Mao said: \u201cRevolution is not a dinner party.\u201d But what if the reality is that after the revolution there is nothing to eat?\nThe question we should raise with respect to Hamas is not just what will happen after it loses this war \u2013 it is what would happen if Hamas was to survive and continue to rule Gaza? What would be the reality in the Strip, after the waning of enthusiasm for liberation?\n[See also: UN commissioner: \u201cGazans could start dying of hunger\u201d]", "source_domain": "www.newstatesman.com", "text": null, "title": "What the left gets wrong about Gaza and \u201cdecolonisation\u201d", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.newstatesman.com/world/middle-east/2023/12/israel-gaza-palestine-peace"}
