Immediately afterward, the war will continue until Hamas is destroyed.\u201d\nTalks around the truce in exchange for the release of hostages have seen Netayahu and his cabinet attempt to balance two competing concerns.\nView image in fullscreen Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel\u2019s national security minister, has been critical of the deal with Hamas. Photograph: Ammar Awad/Reuters\nOn one hand, support for an arrangement to release those held captive by Hamas and other armed Palestinian factions in Gaza enjoys widespread public support, much of which has been galvanised by the campaign waged by the families of the hostages.\nOn the other hand, however, has been the concern that an agreement for a substantial ceasefire could mark the beginning of the end of Israel\u2019s war against Hamas, a concern dismissed by Netanyahu as \u201cnonsense\u201d.\nJustifying his support for a deal he had previously rejected, Netanyahu said: \u201cLet me make clear: we are at war, and we will continue the war until we achieve all our objectives \u2013 eradicating Hamas, bringing back all our hostages and MIAs, and guaranteeing that there will be no figure in Gaza that threatens Israel.\u201d\nIsaac Herzog, Israel\u2019s president, however, acknowledged that the deal \u2013 while moral \u2013 would inspire \u201cunderstandable, painful and difficult misgivings\u201d.\n\u201cIt is a moral and ethical duty that correctly expresses the Jewish and Israeli value of redeeming captives, and I hope that it will be a significant first step for bringing all the captives home,\u201d he said.\nReactions among leading Israeli columnists on Wednesday reflected the continuing political problems that Netanyahu is facing even as he tries to sell the deal, with Nahum Barnea, a journalist for the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, suggesting that \u201cIsrael has no choice but to pay the price\u201d while linking the agreement with the failures of 7 October.\n\u201cThe alternative to forsaking the hostages a second time, after they were first forsaken on October, would have been far worse and far more dangerous. Beyond the price it could end up costing in blood and lives, it would have left an indelible stain on the Israeli government and the IDF.\u201d\nOthers were more damning still. Also writing in Yedioth, Yossi Yehoshua warned that Israel risked missing \u201can historic opportunity to fundamentally change the Gaza problem, and will not only pay for that in soldiers\u2019 lives but by missing out on a better deal\u201d, adding \u201cwe are jeopardising our most important war in recent decades. One man has to own all of this: Binyamin Netanyahu.\u201d\nOn Kan Radio, Gadi Shamni, a former senior military officer, said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure that Netanyahu wants to win this war. This floundering might work for him.\n\u201cNetanyahu already realises that he is going to be remembered in infamy as the man who with his own two hands moulded this crisis. The prime minister delayed the IDF [ground] manoeuvre for weeks \u2013 he didn\u2019t believe in the IDF\u2019s capabilities, and he chose to waste his time.\n\u201cWhat Netanyahu wants, first of all, first and foremost, is to minimise the damage to himself,\u201d he said.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Netanyahu avoids political rebellion over Hamas hostage deal but ally calls it \u2018immoral\u2019", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/22/netanyahu-avoids-political-rebellion-over-hamas-hostage-deal-but-ally-calls-it-immoral"}
