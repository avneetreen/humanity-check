She had been undergoing cancer treatment.\n\u201cThe body of Yehudit Weiss, who was abducted by the Hamas terrorist organisation, was extracted by IDF troops from a structure adjacent to the Shifa hospital in the Gaza Strip and was transferred to Israeli territory,\u201d a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces said late on Thursday.\n\u201cIn the structure in which Yehudit was located, military equipment including Kalashnikov rifles and RPGs were also found,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nWeiss\u2019s husband, Shmulik, was killed during the Hamas attack.\nThe IDF also said it had uncovered a Hamas tunnel shaft and a vehicle with weapons at the Dar al-Shifa hospital complex.\n\u201cIn the Shifa hospital, IDF troops found an operational tunnel shaft and a vehicle containing a large number of weapons,\u201d the military said. It made public videos and photographs of the tunnel shaft and weapons, though no independent verification was possible.\nIsrael dropped leaflets into southern Gaza, telling Palestinian civilians to leave four towns on the eastern edge of Khan Younis, fuelling fears that its offensive would spread south.\nPeople in Bani Shuhaila, Khuza\u2019a, Abassan and al-Qarara were told that anyone in the vicinity of militants or their positions was \u201cputting his life in danger\u201d.\nIsrael\u2019s army chief said forces were close to destroying what he described as the military system that existed in northern Gaza, a day after the IDF entered the Shifa hospital compound.\nThe US president, Joe Biden, speaking late on Wednesday, defended his refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, arguing that Hamas represented a continuing threat to Israel and that Israeli forces were seeking to avoid civilian casualties.\nHe said Israeli forces had switched from aerial bombardment, which he seemed to acknowledge had been indiscriminate in parts, to more targeted ground operations, after more than 11,000 Palestinians were reported to have died.\n\u201cIt is not carpet bombing. This is a different thing. They\u2019re going through these tunnels, they\u2019re going into the hospital,\u201d he said after talks with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.\n00:01:39 Biden defends rejecting calls for ceasefire: Hamas 'plan on attacking Israel again' \u2013 video\nThe White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Thursday that the US was confident in its intelligence assessment that Hamas used the hospital as a command centre.\nIsrael has so far released pictures of what it says were rifles and flak jackets found on the premises, but no evidence of a vast underground Hamas command headquarters it said was operating in tunnels beneath it.\nAn IDF official said on Thursday that troops were still inside the hospital complex, searching one building at a time in \u201ca discrete, methodical and thorough manner\u201d.\nThe official said the IDF had located weapons, intelligence material, military technologies and equipment, command and control centres and communications equipment belonging to Hamas. They added that information and footage about the hostages abducted from Israel were found on computers and other technological equipment.\nOn Wednesday, Hamas described Israel\u2019s claims that military equipment had been found as \u201cnothing but a continuation of the lies and cheap propaganda, through which [Israel] is trying to give justification for its crime aimed at destroying the health sector in Gaza\u201d.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry said IDF troops were searching the underground levels of Shifa hospital and detaining technicians responsible for running its equipment.\nTens of thousands of people have fled from north to south Gaza in recent weeks, crowding into UN-run shelters and family homes in Khan Younis, the biggest city in the south, amid the offensive.\nThe UN\u2019s human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, said that five weeks into the war, \u201cmassive outbreaks of infectious disease, and hunger\u201d seemed inevitable in the densely populated Palestinian territory.\nHe predicted catastrophic consequences if fuel supplies ran out, including the collapse of sewage systems and healthcare and an end to the already scarce supplies of humanitarian aid.\nUN commissioner says killing of Gaza civilians cannot be dismissed as 'collateral damage' \u2013 video\nThe head of the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, said he feared for civil order in Gaza after it was hit with a new communications blackout on Thursday.\nHe added that he believed there was a deliberate attempt to \u201cstrangle\u201d the agency\u2019s humanitarian work in Gaza, warning that it may have to entirely suspend its operations due to a lack of fuel.\nThe director of the Shifa hospital, Muhammad Abu Salmiya, told the BBC that the hospital was packed with 650 patients and about 5,000 displaced people and that it had run out of oxygen and water. \u201cThe conditions are tragic and those in the hospital are screaming from thirst,\u201d he said.\nMunir al-Boursh, a senior official inside the hospital, said troops ransacked the basement and other buildings and questioned and face-screened patients, staff and people sheltering in the facility, the Associated Press reported.\nHundreds of patients inside Shifa, including newborn babies, have suffered for days without electricity and other basic necessities.\nThe hospital has become a strategic objective for Israel, which says there is a Hamas command centre in bunkers underneath, which Hamas and hospital staff deny.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli tanks were laying siege to Gaza\u2019s al-Ahli hospital and that a \u201cviolent attack\u201d was under way. \u201cTeams are unable to move and reach those who are injured,\u201d the organisation said.\n00:01:38 Gaza City before and after: footage shows destruction wreaked by war \u2013 video\nOn Thursday morning, the IDF said Israeli fighter jets had struck the house of the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Gaza. In a social media post that included a video said to show the strike, the IDF said the home \u201cwas used as terrorist infrastructure and a meeting point for Hamas\u2019s senior leaders to direct terrorist attacks against Israel\u201d.\nTwo-thirds of the Gaza Strip\u2019s population of 2.3 million people have been made homeless by the war and every available space in Khan Younis and other southern towns is crammed.\nMohammed Ghalayini, 44, a civil servant from Manchester who is in the centre of Khan Younis, said there was a housing crisis across the city.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a massive influx of people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest place and it\u2019s the place where there\u2019s more potential to find somewhere to stay.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a massive housing crisis. Every day three people that I know call me saying \u2018Can you help me find a place?\u2019 and it\u2019s really hard, because there are no places. Even if you have the space, it\u2019s whether it can support people in terms of water and sanitation.\u201d\nMore than 11,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Palestinian health authorities. Another 2,700 have been reported missing, with most believed to be buried under the rubble.\nThe Israeli army on Thursday announced the deaths of two more soldiers in Gaza, increasing the number of troops killed in the territory to 50 since the start of the war.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel says body of hostage recovered near al-Shifa hospital", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/16/israel-body-of-hostage-recovered-yehudit-weiss-al-shifa-hospital"}
