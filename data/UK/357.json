Violence won\u2019t solve violence. And that is why I refuse.\u201d\nIn a separate written statement, he added that he believed Israel\u2019s extended military response to the 7 October Hamas attack had not been effective at protecting civilian lives in Israel or Gaza.\n\"We must recognize the fact that after weeks of the ground operation in Gaza, at the end of the day - negotiations, an agreement, brought back the hostages. It was actually military action that caused them to be killed,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of the criminal lie that \u2018there are no innocent civilians in Gaza,\u2019 even hostages waving a white flag shouting in Hebrew were shot to death. I don\u2019t want to imagine how many similar cases there were that were not investigated because the victims were born on the wrong side of the fence.\u201d\nHe\u2019s been sentenced to 30 days in a military prison, and could face repeated detention if he continues to object to military service.\nMilitary service is mandatory for most Jewish Israelis, though some are allowed exemptions on religious grounds. Those with political objections to army service are not considered valid objectors.\nAt various points, groups of soldiers have waged high-profile attempts to refuse service or to carry out various operations, including a group of Israeli Air Force pilots in 2003, though 2023 has taken things to a new level.\nIn March, as thousands of Israelis protested a planned judicial reform viewed as an effort to curtail the power of the courts over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces a corruption trial, roughly 700 military reservists resigned in protest.\nAt the time, Mr Netanyahu said, \u201cThere\u2019s no room for refusals,\u201d calling military service \u201cthe first and most important foundation of our existence in our land.\u201d\nThen, in August, a group of over 200 high school students said they would oppose their eventual enlistment, protesting both the judicial reform and the \u201coccupation\u201d of Gaza and the West Bank.\n\u201cFor me, to give full support to settler violence, decades of military rule, and judicial reform that gives all the power to corrupt and clerical politicians completely crosses my red line,\u201d Lily Hochfeld, 17, told972 magazine at the time. \u201cI can no longer enlist in such an army and not fear for my future and that of my country.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Israeli teen jailed for refusing to enlist in army during Hamas war", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/tal-mitnick-israel-draft-hamas-b2470097.html"}
