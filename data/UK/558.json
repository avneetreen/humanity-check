Displaced people have squeezed into shelters mainly in the south in a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\nU.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has expressed unease over Israel\u2019s failure to reduce civilian casualties and its plans for the future of Gaza, but the White House continues to offer wholehearted support for Israel with weapons shipments and diplomatic backing.\n\u201cI want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives,\u201d Biden said Thursday when asked if he wants Israel to scale down its operations by the end of the month. \u201cNot stop going after Hamas, but be more careful.\u201d\nA deadly Hamas ambush on Israeli troops in Gaza City this week showed the group\u2019s resilience and called into question whether Israel can defeat it without wiping out the entire territory.\nIsrael\u2019s air and ground assault over the past 10 weeks has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Thousands more are missing and feared dead beneath the rubble.\nThe ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. Its latest count did not specify how many were women and minors, but they have consistently made up around two-thirds of the dead in previous tallies.\nOn Friday morning, communications services, which telecommunications provider Paltel said Thursday were cut due to ongoing fighting, still appeared to be down across Gaza.\nIsraeli airstrikes and tank shelling continued overnight and into Friday, including in the southern city of Rafah, part of the shrinking areas of tiny, densely populated Gaza to which Palestinian civilians had been told by Israel to evacuate. At least one person was killed, according to an Associated Press journalist who saw the body arriving at a local hospital.\nIsraelis remain strongly supportive of the war and see it as necessary to prevent a repeat of Oct. 7, when Palestinian militants attacked communities across southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 hostage. A total of 116 soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive, which began Oct. 27.\nThe Israeli military on Friday confirmed the recovery of the bodies of three hostages. Two were soldiers, both aged 19, and the third was a 28-year-old dual French-Israeli national kidnapped from a music festival.\nMore than 100 hostages have been freed, most during a cease-fire last month in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\nSullivan was scheduled to meet Friday with Abbas, who lost control of Gaza when Hamas drove out his security forces in 2007. The takeover came a year after Hamas defeated Abbas' Fatah party in parliament elections and the rivals failed to form a unity government.\nA senior U.S. official said that Sullivan and others have discussed the prospect of having those associated with the Palestinian Authority security forces before the Hamas takeover serve as the \u201cnucleus\u201d of postwar peacekeeping in Gaza.\nIt was one idea of many being considered for establishing security in Gaza, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with White House ground rules. He said such talks were taking place with Israel, the Palestinian Authority and regional partners.\nThe U.S. has said it eventually wants to see the West Bank and Gaza under a unified Palestinian government, as a precursor to Palestinian statehood \u2014 an idea soundly rejected by Netanyahu, who leads a right-wing government that is opposed to Palestinian statehood.\nThe Palestinian prime minister told The Associated Press it\u2019s time for the United States to deal more firmly with Israel, particularly on Washington\u2019s calls for postwar negotiations for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\u201cNow that the United States has talked the talk, we want Washington to walk the walk,\u201d Mohammed Shtayyeh said Thursday. \u201cIf the United States cannot deliver Israel, who can?\u201d\nAs part of postwar scenarios, Washington has also called for revitalizing the Palestinian Authority, without letting on whether such reforms would require personnel changes or general elections, which last took place 17 years ago.\nThe 88-year-old Abbas is deeply unpopular, with a poll published Wednesday indicating close to 90% of Palestinians want him to resign. Meanwhile, Palestinian support for Hamas has tripled in the West Bank, with a small uptick in Gaza, according to the poll. Still, a majority of Palestinians do not back Hamas, according to the survey.\n__\nJobain reported from Rafah, Gaza Strip, and Mroue from Beirut.
