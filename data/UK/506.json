It first launched the Hwasong-18- its most advanced and powerful ICBM, in April, then again in July.\nThe Hwasong-18 is North Korea's first ICBM to use solid fuel, which makes it easier to transport and faster to launch than liquid-fueled versions.\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson said they were analyzing whether Monday's launch was a solid-fueled ICBM.\nPark Won-gon, a professor of North Korean Studies at Ewha University, said there was a high possibility Pyongyang test-fired a Hwasong-18\n'The Hwasong-18 uses solid fuel, so there will be no preparation time, and it can be fired immediately from a mobile launcher, and it can be seen as a weapon system with a practical ability to strike the US mainland,' Park explained.\nThe Hwasong-18 is North Korea's first ICBM to use solid fuel, which makes it easier to transport and faster to launch than liquid-fueled versions\nNorth Korea last year declared itself an 'irreversible' nuclear power and has repeatedly said it will never give up its nuclear program, which the regime views as essential for its survival.\nThe United States and South Korea on Friday held their second session of the Nuclear Consultative Group in Washington, where they discussed nuclear deterrence in the event of conflict with the North.\nOn Saturday, they warned that any nuclear attack from Pyongyang on the United States and South Korea would result in the end of the North Korean regime.\nA spokesperson for North Korea's defense ministry on Sunday slammed the allies' plans to expand annual joint military exercise next year to include a nuclear operation drill.\n'This is an open declaration on nuclear confrontation to make the use of nuclear weapons against the DPRK a fait accompli,' said a statement carried by the KCNA news agency, using the official acronym for North Korea.\nNorth Korea's missile launch came as the nation marks the anniversary of leader Kim Jong Un's father and predecessor Kim Jong Il\n'Any attempt to use armed forces against the DPRK will face a preemptive and deadly counteraction,' it added.\nThe North's launch of its military spy satellite launch last month further damaged ties.\nThe North portrayed it as a major breakthrough, claiming it was providing images of US and South Korean military sites.\nThat launch fractured a military agreement between the Koreas established to de-escalate tensions on the peninsula.\nFollowing the spy satellite launch, both sides ramped up security along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating them.\n'If North Korea does something reckless that destroys peace, all that awaits them is a hell of destruction,' South Korea's Defense Minister Shin Won-sik warned in a meeting with top military commanders last week.\nKCNA also cited North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as saying his military had 'eyes overlooking a very long distance and a strong fist beating a very long distance'.\nProfessor Park said the 'fist' referred to the Hwasong-18.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "North Korea fires nuclear-capable missile with range to target ENTIRE United States, Japan says", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12875665/North-Korea-fires-nuclear-capable-missile-range-target-ENTIRE-United-States-Japan-says.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"}
