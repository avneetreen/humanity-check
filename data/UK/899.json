That came in exchange for the safe return of 13 Israelis held in the Gaza Strip as hostages since Hamas attacked communities in the south of the country last month, sparking the deadliest round of fighting in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict to date.\nFor a handful of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian families with members in Israeli military prisons, the anxious wait ended on Friday night, as 24 women and 15 children were shuttled into Betunia, a suburb of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, on two International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) buses. They were greeted with singing, Palestinian flags, the flags of the militant wings of Hamas and the West Bank\u2019s dominant Fatah party, and the hugs and tears of their mothers, fathers, sons and daughters.\n\u201cThis is a happy day but it is also filled with sadness,\u201d said Fairuz Fayez Mahmoud Al-Bu, a 26-year-old from Abu Dis who had been held in administrative detention \u2013 without charge or trial \u2013 for more than two years. She was arrested for allegedly stabbing an Israeli, an allegation she denies.\n\u201cThe war in Gaza is still happening and our people are dying.\u201d\nAfter weeks of frantic diplomatic efforts \u2013 brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the US \u2013 Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian group in control of Gaza, agreed a four-day ceasefire that went into effect on Friday at 7am (5am GMT), 24 hours later than originally planned.\nFamilies across Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories endured a tense day before it emerged that the pause in hostilities was holding, and the hostage releases could begin. The families of the first group of 13 Israeli children and elderly women to be released were told by Israeli authorities to gather at a hospital complex before their loved ones\u2019 expected arrival, where they were reunited after seven weeks apart with almost no news or signs of life.\nFor the Palestinians, the details remained unclear until the last minute after the Israeli justice ministry published the names of 300 women and children who would be considered for release on Thursday. There was no forthcoming information about when, where or how they would be released before the buses arrived at the Betunia checkpoint on Friday night, where families had gathered in hope.\nFor Najah Awad, 43, the wait continues. Her daughter, now 24, was sentenced to 13 years for stabbing a passerby in Jerusalem in 2015.\n\u201cNoorhan was only 16 years old when she was arrested. Now she is 24, and we haven\u2019t been able to visit her since the war started, we have had no news,\u201d Awad said.\n\u201cI knew from the newspaper when they published the names. I am really happy, but I will not believe it until I see it. We prepared her room for her. I can\u2019t wait for her to be home.\u201d\nThe ceasefire deal includes a clause stipulating that after the initial four-day ceasefire, there will be an additional day in which fighting is paused, up to a total of 10 days. For every 10 Gaza hostages that come home safely, three times as many Palestinians in Israeli jails will be released.\nThe deal on prisoner releases has shone a light on Israeli detention and sentencing practices in the Palestinian territories, where Palestinians are tried in military courts with a more than 98% conviction rate and in which minors are regularly imprisoned.\nAll but four on the list of 300 are from the West Bank and Jerusalem. Israel refused to release anyone sentenced for murder; most are held for stone-throwing, damaging property, having contact with \u201chostile\u201d organisations, and more serious charges such as attempted murder and manufacturing explosives.\nAbout 1,200 Israelis were killed and 240 taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October, after which Israel declared a war on the Palestinian militant group. More than 14,800 people have been killed in intensive bombings and an unprecedented ground operations, according to the local health ministry.\nThe new war in Gaza \u2013 the fifth since Hamas seized control of the strip in 2007 - has destroyed more than 40% of the strip\u2019s housing stock, the UN says, as well as medical infrastructure. The exclave\u2019s population of 2.3 million is facing a severe humanitarian crisis, with inadequate water, food, fuel and medicine.\nThe Israeli campaign has split the territory into two halves, with most of the population now pushed to the south. The Israel Defense Forces has said northern Gaza, where its offensive is currently focused, remains out of bounds, and that displaced Palestinians trying to return to the area will not be allowed to enter.\nIsrael has a history of agreeing to asymmetrical prisoner swaps: in 2011, Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, returned home after five years of captivity in the Gaza Strip in exchange for 1,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails.\nHamas had previously released four hostages unilaterally: Judith Tai Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie Raanan, a woman and daughter with dual Israeli-US citizenship, on 20 October, followed by two elderly Israeli women, Yocheved Lifshitz and Nurit Yitzhak, on 23 October. One soldier, a 19-year-old, was rescued by Israeli forces.\nMilitant groups in the strip have claimed that several hostages have been killed by Israeli bombings, but only one death has been confirmed by Israeli authorities.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018I won\u2019t believe it until I see it\u2019: Palestinians gather to greet freed prisoners", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/24/palestinians-gather-outside-israeli-prison-in-hope-of-greeting-freed-prisoners"}
