The two countries have seen a significant reduction in trade volume since the start of the war.\nIt had also recalled its ambassador to Israel after the continuous bombing which has affected civilians in Gaza. Turkey has also seen massive protests against Israeli operations in Gaza, writes Reuters.\nThe massive assault by Hamas militants on October 7 resulted in the deaths of 1,400 people in Israel. They also took more than 200 people as captives. The Hamas gunmen crossed over into Israel by land, sea, and air, attacking the southern and central parts of Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.\nIn retaliation for the Hamas attacks, Israel's prime minister formally declared war against the militant outfit.\nA third mice released in a McDonald's this time in small heath Birmingham McDonald's https://t.co/7k6Y9c9Q5c pic.twitter.com/gqP8L96acU \u2014 London & UK Street News (@CrimeLdn) November 1, 2023\nMore than 10,000 Palestinians, including 4,104 children, have since been killed in retaliatory Israeli strikes after the Hamas attack, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which is also controlled by Hamas.\nRecently, fast food chain McDonald's also came under fire for giving out free food to the Israel Defense Forces.\nThe fast food chain decided to give free meals to IDF soldiers during the first week of the war against Hamas.\nSome social media posts claimed that it had given out 100,000 free meals.
