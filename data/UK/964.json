I would like to make it clear: As of now, there has been no deal. But I want to promise: When there is something to say we will report to you about it.\u201d\nIsraeli defense forces (IDF) are currently carrying out ground operations in Gaza to destroy Hamas after the militant group\u2019s rampage into Israel on 7 October in which its fighters killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages.\nIsrael also said it is preparing to expand its offensive in the strip.\nA senior aide to Mr Netanyahu urged Palestinian civilians to relocate away from southern Khan Younis, indicating that a ground offensive into the south is imminent.\nIDF said it was fighting militants in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City and on the outskirts of Jabaliya, the refugee camp which is home to one of two schools that were allegedly hit by airstrikes on Saturday.\nThe Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry says the death toll in the Gaza Strip has already increased to 12,300, including 5,000 children.\nMeanwhile, the families of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas and thousands of supporters arrived after a five-day march in Jerusalem on Saturday.\nThe marchers sought to pressure Israel\u2019s government to do everything they could to bring hostages back.\nSome of the marchers have expressed fear that the Israel military offensive endangers their loved ones but government leaders argue that only military pressure on Hamas can lead to some hostage releases.\nSo far of the 240 hostages kidnapped from Israel into Gaza, only five have been released \u2013 four via international diplomacy involving Qatar and one rescued by Israeli troops.\nA humanitarian assessment team that visited Al Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza reported seeing signs of shelling and gunfire in what was described as a \u201cdeath zone\u201d in a \u201cdesperate\u201d situation, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nPeople search buildings destroyed during airstrikes on November 18, 2023 in Khan Yunis, Gaza.

The team saw a mass grave at the entrance of the hospital and were told more than 80 people were buried there,\u201d the WHO said in a statement.\nThe assessment team which included public health experts, logistics officers, and security staff from various UN departments could reportedly spend only an hour inside the hospital due to security concerns.\nTheir visit, while coordinated with the Israeli military, still occurred with heavy fighting near the hospital.\n\u201cWHO and partners are urgently developing plans for the immediate evacuation of the remaining patients, staff and their families,\u201d the UN organisation said.\nThe hospital was not functioning as a medical facility, according to the team, due to a scarcity of clean water, fuel, medicine, and other essentials.\nPalestinians search the rubble of a building for survivors follwoing Israeli bombardment in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip on 18 November 2023 amid ongoing battles between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.
