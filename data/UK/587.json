Among these, vectored thrust is expected to remain dominant since vectored thrust models have efficient lift and cruise capabilities and since they use the same set of rotors for both operations, they offer some advantage in terms of lightweight as well. Leading OEMs like Joby, Vertical Aerospace, Beta Technologies, Wisk, etc. have chosen the vectored thrust configuration for their first program.\nBased on the Application Type- The eVTOL market is divided into passenger transport and cargo. Passenger transport is expected to remain dominant with more than 50% of the share till 2040, while cargo transport is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years due to the growing demand for fast and efficient delivery of goods.\nBased on the Seating Capacity Type- The market is divided into 1-Seater, 2-Seater, 3-Seater, 4-Seater, 5-Seater, 5+ Seater. Programs having a seating capacity of 4-8 passengers will dominate the market since more passengers would mean more revenue per aircraft.\nThe growing popularity of air taxis for urban transportation will drive the demand for eVTOLs with larger seating capacities.\nTo know the attractive segments, click here for a free sample pdf:\nhttps://www.stratviewresearch.com/Request-Sample/3264/evtol-market.html#form\nWhich Region Offers the Best Opportunity and Growth?\nThe report suggests that the presence of leading OEMs is almost evenly distributed between North America and Europe in the current scenario. However, the number of upcoming programs from the NA region far exceeds that of Europe, which will lead to the dominance of North America in the future. The presence of cities capable of supporting the UAM infrastructure will further propel the quick adoption of eVTOLs in North America and Europe.\neVTOL Market Drivers\nSome of the key drivers listed in the report are given below.\nThe market is driven by stringent government regulations that aim to reduce carbon emissions in the transportation sector.\nIn addition, increasing urbanization and population growth have led to city congestion, creating a need for new transportation solutions.\nBased on the claims being made by the leading OEMs, eVTOLs are expected to have at least 35% lower CO2 emissions as compared to ICEVs.\nFor Customization or Any Other Queries, Get in Touch with Our Industry Experts at sales@stratviewresearch.com\nTop Companies in the eVTOL Market?\nThe market is fairly consolidated with the presence of some global and regional players.
