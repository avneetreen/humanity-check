Just like the spotters, her warnings were brushed off dismissively,\u201d it said.\n\u201cWhile they were distributed to senior officers, to her own unit and to field intelligence, a senior intelligence officer wrote to her in response, praising her work but adding: \u2018It sounds imaginary to me,\u2019 almost exactly echoing the language of the leaked 8200 emails.\u201d\nAccording to this telling of events, V\u2019s direct commander backed up her assessment, insisting it was a real exercise and not a display. The warnings were reiterated by the soldiers involved a few weeks before 7 October when an unnamed senior intelligence officer visited their base and the intelligence was presented to him.\nDespite the warnings, however, even of the eve of 7 October, when senior officers discussed the prospect of an imminent Hamas attack, senior officers in the IDF were describing the evidence as \u201cweak\u201d.\nThe Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported that on 6 October, hours before Hamas launched its assault, the IDF\u2019s most senior officers were alerted to \u201cweak signs\u201d that something was happening on the Gaza border and that Hamas was preparing for an offensive.\nCommenting on the claims, the IDF said: \u201cThese days the IDF is entirely focused on fighting the terrorist organisation Hamas. After the war, the IDF will conduct a thorough, incisive and uncompromising investigation and publish its findings to the public.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israeli intelligence leak details extent of warnings over Hamas attack", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/28/israeli-military-had-warning-of-hamas-training-for-attack-reports-say"}
