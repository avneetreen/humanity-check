As we reported earlier, the UN court has said it will issue a decision on Friday on South Africa\u2019s request for interim orders in a genocide case against Israel, including that Israel stop its military campaign in Gaza. In the ruling on Friday, the ICJ will not deal with the main question of whether Israel is committing genocide. The court will only look at possible emergency measures, whereas the full case could take years to decide. South Africa wants the court to issue so-called \u201cprovisional measures\u201d \u2013 emergency orders to protect Palestinians in Gaza from potential breaches of the UN\u2019s Genocide Convention. But the court is not bound to order exactly what Pretoria asked for. Orders from the ICJ are legally binding and cannot be appealed, but the court has no way to enforce them.\nUpdated at 19.15 CET\n24 Jan 2024 18.57 CET Houthis fired three missiles at ships in Red Sea, says White House Yemen\u2019s Houthi forces fired missiles at ships in the Red Sea on Wednesday, the White House has said.

In a statement on Wednesday, they called on UN member states to \u201cstop fuelling the crisis in Gaza and avert further humanitarian catastrophe and loss of civilian life\u201d. The 16 signatories include Amnesty International, Oxfam, Save the Children, Christian Aid, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and the M\u00e9decins du Monde international network. The statement reads: Israel\u2019s bombardment and siege are depriving the civilian population of the basics to survive and rendering Gaza uninhabitable. Today, the civilian population in Gaza faces a humanitarian crisis of unprecedented severity and scale. It says Israel continues to use explosive weapons and munitions in densely populated areas in Gaza with \u201cmassive humanitarian consequences\u201d, is killing people at \u201cunprecedented levels\u201d and destroying a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of Gaza\u2019s homes, schools, hospitals, water infrastructure, shelters, and refugee camps. Gaza\u2019s remaining lifeline \u2013 an internationally funded humanitarian aid response \u2013 has been paralysed by the intensity of the hostilities, which have included the shooting of aid convoys, recurrent communications blackouts, damaged roads, restrictions on essential supplies, an almost complete ban on commercial supplies, and a bureaucratic process to send aid into Gaza. It says Gaza today is \u201cthe most dangerous place to be a child, a journalist, and an aid worker\u201d, where hospitals and schools have become \u201cbattlegrounds\u201d. The statement continues: We demand an immediate ceasefire and call on all states to halt the transfer of weapons that can be used to commit violations of international humanitarian and human rights law \u2026 All states have an obligation to prevent atrocity crimes and promote adherence to norms that protect civilians.\nUpdated at 18.21 CET\n24 Jan 2024 17.45 CET Italy has announced it will launch an operation to provide hospital treatment for 100 Palestinian children from Gaza.

Another 30 children and their families will be transported to Italy at the end of January onboard a military vessel that will depart from the Egyptian port of al-Arish, he said. The children will be treated in hospitals in Bologna, Florence, Genoa and Rome, a statement by Crosetto said. The minister did not clarify when or how the remaining 40 children would be transported, Reuters reported. The move was \u201ca moral duty more than a political one\u201d, he said, adding: One cannot remain indifferent in the face of the serious humanitarian crisis.

The demonstration marked a rare show of protest in the devastated and besieged Palestinian territory, where people are struggling to get by amid the war and humanitarian crisis, AP reported. Demonstrators, mostly women and children, chanted: \u201cPeople want to end the war\u201d and \u201cWe want to go back to the north [of Gaza].\u201d One sign carried by a young girl read: \u201cYes to returning the prisoners.\u201d The protest was seized on by an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson who said it was evidence that Palestinians were demanding Hamas release the hostages taken during the 7 October attacks in order to end the war. However, there was no indication the protesters directed their demonstration at Hamas specifically, AP wrote. A poll published last month showed Palestinian support in Gaza for Hamas had risen since the war erupted.\nUpdated at 17.19 CET\n24 Jan 2024 16.56 CET Two US-flagged vessels transiting the Bab el-Mandeb strait, accompanied by the US navy, turned around after seeing explosions nearby, according to the shipping company Maersk.
