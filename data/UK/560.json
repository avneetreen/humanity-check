Concrete is expected to remain the largest segment of the market during the forecast period. Concrete is the most commonly used construction material as it poses high compressive strength, high-temperature resistance, and excellent water resistance characteristics. In addition to that, a growing population coupled with urbanization and increasing per capita income is further expected to drive the market.\nBased on the end-user type - The market is segmented as infrastructure, commercial, residential, and industrial.
