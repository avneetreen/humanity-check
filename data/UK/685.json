Both attacks were in the central Gaza neighbourhood of Deir al-Balah.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to Amnesty International, there was no evidence that there were \u201cany military objectives at the sites\u201d or that any of the people in the buildings were \u201clegitimate military targets.\u201d This has led the group to accuse Israel of using US weapons to carry out direct or indiscriminate attacks on Palestinian civilians, which would be an international humanitarian violation, which Amnesty said should be investigated as war crimes.\n\u201cTwo families have been decimated in these strikes, further proof that the Israeli military is responsible for unlawfully killing and injuring civilians in its bombardment of Gaza,\u201d Amnesty Secretary General Agn\u00e9s Callamard said in a statement Tuesday.\nA spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told CNN that Amnesty\u2019s report is \u201cflawed, biased and premature.\u201d Israeli authorities previously had friction with Amnesty when the organisation released a report accusing the government of engaging in apartheid against Palestinians.\n\u201cTwo families have been decimated in these strikes, further proof that the Israeli military is responsible for unlawfully killing and injuring civilians in its bombardment of Gaza.\u201d - Agn\u00e9s Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International\nAdvertisement\nThe US government has served as a powerful financial and diplomatic ally to Israel, with many American leaders vocalising unconditional support for the nation \u2015 particularly after October 7, when Hamas militants launched an assault on Israel that resulted in about 1,200 deaths and the taking of hundreds of hostages.\nIt is widely understood that Israel\u2019s military uses US weaponry for both offensive and defensive purposes. But Amnesty\u2019s report is one of the first investigations that directly connect an American munition to an attack on Gaza that resulted in mass civilian deaths.\nThe munition central to Amnesty\u2019s report, the JDAM, is a \u201cguidance tail kit that converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into accurate, adverse weather \u2018smart\u2019 munitions,\u201d according to the US Air Force\u2019s website.\nAt its most accurate, the JDAM system attached to a bomb will guide it to within 16 feet of the target \u201cwhen GPS data is available,\u201d the Air Force description said, or within about 100 feet soon after a high-quality siting from the aircraft.\nAdvertisement\nThe first JDAM strike in Amnesty\u2019s report occurred on October 10 and killed 21 members of the al-Najjar family and three neighbours. Suleiman Salman al-Najjar, who survived the attack, told the group that his wife and four children were among those killed. The Boeing-made JDAM that hit the al-Najjar family home likely weighed 2,000 pounds, according to the group\u2019s weapons experts and a \u201cremote sensing analyst.\u201d\n\u201cI was shocked. I rushed home and saw a scene of utter destruction. I could not believe my eyes. Everybody was under the rubble. The house was completely pulverized. The bodies were reduced to shreds,\u201d al-Najjar told Amnesty International.\n\u201cOnly the body of my son Nadim (20) was recovered whole. My baby girl, Safa (17 months), we only found her hand,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, me and my two surviving sons live in a tent by the ruins of our home. Our lives have been destroyed in a moment. Our family has been destroyed. Something that was unthinkable is now our reality.\u201d\nRelatives of dead Palestinians mourn at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital as the Israeli attacks continue in December in Deir Al-Balah, in the Gaza Strip. A report by Amnesty International says Israel used U.S. weapons to kill dozens of civilians in this neighborhood.

The attack killed 18 members of the family, including 12 children and six women, as well as a neighbour, according to the report. Amnesty estimates that the JDAM-guided bomb that killed much of the Mu\u2019eileq family weighed at least 1,000 pounds.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe are three brothers married to three sisters, living among ourselves focused on our families and work and far from politics,\u201d survivor Bakir Abu Mu\u2019eileq told Amnesty. \u201cWe are doctors and scientists, and our focus is living a good life and building a good future for our children.\u201d\n\u201cWe cannot understand why our homes were bombed. We have never had any problem previously. It is the same for our neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nobody armed or political here. Our lives, our families, were destroyed completely, obliterated. Why?\u201d\nAmnesty said it found metal fragments of the JDAMs in the rubble of the destroyed homes and included photos of the fragments and rubble in its report.\n\u201cThe fact that US-made munitions are being used by Israeli military in unlawful attacks with deadly consequences for civilians should be an urgent wake-up call to the Biden administration. The US-made weapons facilitated the mass killings of extended families,\u201d Callamard said in a statement.\n\u201cTo knowingly assist in violations is contrary to the obligation to ensure respect for international humanitarian law,\u201d she said. \u201cA state that continues to supply arms being used to commit violations may share responsibility for these violations.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nA spokesperson for the State Department told HuffPost that the agency is reviewing Amnesty\u2019s report and takes seriously any allegations of civilian harm. The department also reiterated that it has communicated with Israeli leaders its concerns about civilian protection and that Israeli forces must adhere to the laws of armed conflict.\nIn its report, Amnesty International implored the US government to follow its own policies, which include guidance to prevent arms transfers that risk aiding in civilian harm and in the violation of international humanitarian law. Last month, the White House requested to lift restrictions on Israel\u2019s access to a stockpile of US weapons that the Pentagon placed in Israel for use in regional conflicts.", "source_domain": "www.huffingtonpost.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Report Says Israel Used US Weapons To Kill Gaza Families", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/amnesty-report-says-israel-used-us-weapons-to-kill-dozens-of-gaza-civilians_uk_6572f2e4e4b08a047529ea8b"}
