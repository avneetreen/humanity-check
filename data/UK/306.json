It\u2019s beyond devastating.\u201d\nView image in fullscreen Maya Puder was a second-year film student at Tel Aviv University. Photograph: Family photo\nMaya went to the festival at the Re\u2019im kibbutz, three miles from the Gaza border, with her friends, Rotem, 25, who was found dead inside the shelter, and Lior, 25, who survived after hiding under a dead body for six hours.\nLior told Maya\u2019s family that Hamas gunmen threw grenades inside the shelter where they were hiding to lure them out. He said Maya, a second-year film student at Tel Aviv University, escaped at the same time as him but he did not see what happened to her.\nAyala Puder, a 54-year-old British-Israeli interior designer, said: \u201cThe first four days that we were here sitting and waiting, it was like the time was not passing but yet it was going so fast. We were in turmoil; wanting her to be hiding somewhere, wanting her to be kidnapped, afraid of her being kidnapped.\n\u201cWe were going on a rollercoaster between having the hope of her being somewhere or kidnapped and the devastating thought of her being killed.\u201d\nThe family\u2019s worst fears came true on 11 October when officials informed them that Maya had been shot dead. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many gunshots because they wouldn\u2019t tell us and we couldn\u2019t see her before we buried her,\u201d Puder said. \u201cBecause of the state of the body, they wouldn\u2019t let us. They said that they did a DNA test and they\u2019re 100% sure that it\u2019s Maya.\u201d\nShe said more than 2,000 people attended Maya\u2019s funeral. \u201cShe was everyone\u2019s best friend,\u201d Puder said. \u201cShe was witty and funny. And as much as you can see, she was pretty on the outside, she was beautiful, but she was beautiful on the inside. She was a loving person.\u201d\nPuder said she and Maya\u2019s father, Avi, 57, and sisters Eliya, 24, and Halleli, 18, had been going through \u201cthe worst nightmare\u201d since the attack on what some in Israel now refer to as Black Saturday.\n\u201cTime has stood still. Every day we wake up to another hard day,\u201d said Puder. \u201cThe whole family is not the same. We are not the way we were. For part of the day, we still live on 7 October, maybe 6 October, sometimes. And then the rest of the time we\u2019re just trying to keep our head above water and trying to find the way to live our life the best we can.\u201d\nView image in fullscreen Maya Puder\u2019s mother said her daughter was \u2018everyone\u2019s best friend\u2019. Photograph: Family photo\nShe said it had also been difficult for the family to watch the war play out and to hear about the three hostages who were killed by mistake by the Israel Defense Forces. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard that we don\u2019t see the end of this war. We feel like our family lost the war in the first hour,\u201d Puder said.\nPolice have recently returned Maya\u2019s phone after it was retrieved from the festival. It has been both painful and amusing for the family to go through Maya\u2019s photographs, contacts and even the movie scripts she was working on.\nIn one script she wrote in the month before the Hamas attack, Maya had imagined a scene in which two friends were shot dead by terrorists on Israel\u2019s Memorial Day.\n\u201cI think she saw her death coming,\u201d Eliya said. \u201cIn the script, there are gunshots and the main character sees her friend die and fall to the ground. Then she describes how the whole world is moving slowly but then she also gets shot, and all that is left of her is her phone.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018We live on 7 October\u2019: Hamas victim Maya Puder remembered by her family", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/01/we-live-on-7-october-hamas-victim-maya-puder-remembered-by-her-family"}
