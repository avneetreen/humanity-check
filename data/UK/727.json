Both grew up in the Khan Younis refugee camp, where Sinwar was born in 1962 while Gaza was under Egyptian administration.\nGaza\u2019s south is historically one of the most socially conservative areas of the coastal strip and Hamas has long enjoyed support there, not least in Khan Younis itself, home to one of Hamas\u2019s five Qassam \u201cbrigades\u201d. Israeli military assessments depict the Hamas structure in the city as being the least damaged by its offensive so far.\nThe reality is that while the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claim to have killed numerous lower-ranking Hamas commanders, issuing a photograph of one group in a tunnel that had those killed marked, the group\u2019s most senior leadership has so far avoided a similar fate \u2013 in keeping with previous conflicts.\nThe aim of the expanded operation in the south, senior IDF officers have said publicly, is to catch or kill Sinwar and other members of the senior leadership.\n\u201cWe are attacking the centre of gravity,\u201d the IDF chief of staff, Gen Herzi Halevi, said on Tuesday. \u201cWe are asked frequently about the destruction in Gaza. Hamas is the address. Sinwar is the address.\u201d\nView image in fullscreen Palestinians walk through the streets of Khan Younis on Wednesday after Israeli strikes. Photograph: Ahmed Zakot/Reuters\nIt remains the case, however, that the three men who sit atop Hamas\u2019s secretive military council and Israel\u2019s hitlist \u2013 Deif, his second in command, Marwan Issa, and Sinwar \u2013 remain at large.\n\u201cIf [Israel] could say we\u2019ve killed Sinwar, we\u2019ve killed Marwan Issa, we\u2019ve killed Mohammed Deif, that\u2019s a very clear, symbolic and substantive achievement,\u201d said Michael Eisenstadt, the director of the military and security studies programme at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, last week. \u201cWhat if they can\u2019t get the guys? Do they keep fighting until they get them? And what if they just prove elusive?\u201d\nHalevi, however, has also made clear that the IDF and Israeli political leadership sees an operation expanded into the south \u2013 contrary to the complaints of some families of Hamas hostages \u2013 as a way of pressuring Hamas back to negotiations over the remaining 138 hostages.\nSome Israeli commentators have suggested that the terrain in Khan Younis and the composition of Hamas\u2019s forces there may make the IDF take a different approach to they way its operated in the north.\n\u201cThe operation in Khan Younis is an inseparable part of the war, but it is being fought in a completely different way from the way the war was fought in the northern Gaza Strip,\u201d suggested Yossi Yehoshua in Yedioth Ahronoth, the Israeli daily.\n\u201cHamas has an entire brigade operating in the Khan Younis area. That brigade has four strong and well-trained battalions, protecting one of Hamas\u2019s main strongholds. Khan Younis is larger than Gaza City in terms of square kilometres.\n\u201cMost of the buildings in it are low-rise apartment buildings, as opposed to the high-rises in downtown Gaza City. There are dozens of kilometres of tunnels run beneath it, in some cases reaching as far as Rafah [in Gaza\u2019s far south on the Egyptian border].\u201d\nFor those Palestinians who have been displaced once \u2013 if not several times \u2013 by the fighting, the ground assault on Khan Younis has simply brought more pain and mortal fear.\nAs the Israeli military has ordered people out of nearly two-dozen neighbourhoods in and around the city it has shrunk the area where it says civilians can seek refuge by more than a quarter, despite having ordered them to move south for safety earlier in the war.\nOn Wednesday, that meant almost empty streets as residents sought shelter from tank shelling and artillery fire, while dead and wounded people continued to be brought into the city\u2019s hospitals.\nEven then, it was unclear how many people heeded the evacuation orders, with many Palestinians saying they did not feel safe anywhere in Gaza, and fearing that if they left their homes they would not be allowed to return.\n\u201cNowhere is safe in Gaza,\u201d said the UN humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths. \u201cNot hospital, not shelters, not refugee camps. No one is safe.\u201d\nHassan al-Qadi, a displaced Khan Younis resident now in Rafah, said: \u201cThe whole city is suffering from destruction and relentless shelling. Many people arriving from northern Gaza are facing dire circumstances. Many are homeless and some are searching for their missing children.\n\u201cWe are not mere numbers. We are human beings.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel\u2019s focus turns to Khan Younis as it hunts for Hamas leaders", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/06/israels-focus-turns-to-khan-younis-as-it-hunts-for-hamas-leaders"}
