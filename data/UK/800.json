The prison service said the Palestinians were released from prisons in Israel, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem under the seventh swap, Reuters reported. This is Adam Fulton picking up our live coverage. Stay with us for all the latest development in the Israel-Hamas war\n1 Dec 2023 03.23 CET Summary It\u2019s approaching 4.30am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. Here\u2019s an overview of where things stand: Eight Israeli hostages held in Gaza were released on Thursday. Hamas freed six of the hostages hours after releasing two Israeli women. All were handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza and were being brought to Israel to be taken to hospitals and be reunited with their families, the Israeli military said.\nIsrael released 30 Palestinians from Israeli jails as part of latest exchange, the Israel Prison Service said early on Friday. News agency images show them being welcomed by jubilant crowds Ramallah in the West Bank.\nHamas is willing to further extend the truce to pause fighting with Israel , a source close to Hamas has told Agence France-Presse. The extension is due to expire early on Friday after a seven-day pause. The source was quoted as saying mediators were making intense efforts to have the truce continued. Israel had yet to respond, AFP said.\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken said in Tel Aviv on Thursday: \u201cClearly, we want to see this process continue to move forward.\u201d Blinken also stepped up calls for Israel to comply with international law and spare civilians in the war against Hamas in Gaza.\nThree people were killed and 13 injured after two brothers from East Jerusalem shot at people waiting at a bus stop on a main road towards the western edge of the city in the rush hour, local police and medics reported. Hamas\u2019s armed wing, al-Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility for the attack.\nAn Israeli military assault into the south of Gaza may lead to 1 million refugees, the head of the UN\u2019s Palestine relief agency, UNRWA, has warned. After a second overnight visit to Gaza, Philippe Lazzarini urged Israel to think through the consequences of an offensive in the south if the temporary truce in the fighting was not extended.\nSeventeen Thai hostages freed by Hamas over recent days have landed back in Bangkok, where relatives had gathered at the airport to welcome them home. The latest releases bring the total number of Thai nationals freed to 23, with nine still being held.\nUpdated at 03.44 CET\n1 Dec 2023 02.56 CET Israel knew of Hamas\u2019s attack plan more than a year ago, according to a report in the New York Times. The report says a blueprint reviewed by the Times laid out the attack in detail, but that Israeli officials dismissed it as aspirational and ignoring specific warnings. The NYT report says: Israeli officials obtained Hamas\u2019s battle plan for the Oct. 7 terrorist attack more than a year before it happened, documents, emails and interviews show. But Israeli military and intelligence officials dismissed the plan as aspirational, considering it too difficult for Hamas to carry out. The approximately 40-page document, which the Israeli authorities code-named \u201cJericho Wall,\u201d outlined, point by point, exactly the kind of devastating invasion that led to the deaths of about 1,200 people. The translated document, which was reviewed by The New York Times, did not set a date for the attack, but described a methodical assault designed to overwhelm the fortifications around the Gaza Strip, take over Israeli cities and storm key military bases, including a division headquarters. Hamas followed the blueprint with shocking precision. \u2026 Officials privately concede that, had the military taken these warnings seriously and redirected significant reinforcements to the south, where Hamas attacked, Israel could have blunted the attacks or possibly even prevented them. \u2026 The Israeli military and the Israeli Security Agency, which is in charge of counterterrorism in Gaza, declined to comment.\n1 Dec 2023 02.13 CET On the number of hostages released by Hamas in the latest exchange, Agence France-Presse is reporting how the truce deal stipulates that a minimum of 10 Israeli captives should be released alive each day. The militant group released just eight Israelis on Thursday. But a source close to Hamas told AFP that two Russian-Israeli women freed on Wednesday in addition to 10 others made up for only eight being released on Thursday. Mediator Qatar appeared to back the calculation. In exchange under the extended truce deal \u2013 due to expire within hours \u2013 Israeli prison authorities said 30 Palestinians prisoners were freed overnight on Thursday. Since the agreement came into force on 24 November, 110 hostages have been released, including 80 Israelis. The majority of the 30 non-Israeli hostages freed were from Thailand, released under a separate agreement. Israel has freed 240 Palestinian prisoners in exchange.\n1 Dec 2023 01.45 CET Al Jazeera is reporting that a bus carrying newly released Palestinian detainees has been hit with tear gas fired by Israeli forces, according to a witness. The network\u2019s report says Issam Rimawi, a Palestinian photojournalist, witnessed and recorded the incident and said Israeli forces were deployed outside Ofer prison in the West Bank before the release of the Palestinian prisoners. The report quotes Rimawi as telling Al Jazeera in Ramallah: They were firing tear gas just as the bus carrying the prisoners was leaving The prisoners were suffocating, and the driver had to stop the bus until the Red Cross crew came to help them. The medical team had to go into the bus, and we have documented this with our own camera. The Israeli authorities are doing this because they don\u2019t want people to celebrate the release of the prisoners. The Al Jazeera Media Network is funded by the Qatari royal family and says it has editorial independence. The Israel Prison Service said early on Friday it had released 30 Palestinians from Israeli jails as part of the latest exchange for hostages under Israel\u2019s truce agreement with Hamas.\nUpdated at 01.49 CET\n30 Nov 2023 00.56 CET Here\u2019s more around the Agence France-Presse report that Hamas has said it is willing to further extend the truce pausing fighting with Israel. Israel had yet to respond, the news agency reports. The current truce is due to expire early on Friday after a seven-day pause. US secretary of state Antony Blinken urged an extension after meeting with leaders in Israel and the occupied West Bank. \u201cClearly, we want to see this process continue to move forward,\u201d he told reporters in Tel Aviv on Thursday. We want an eighth day and beyond. Blinken also said Israel \u201cmust put in place humanitarian civilian protection plans that minimise further casualties of innocent Palestinians, including by clearly and precisely designating areas and places in southern and central Gaza, where they can be safe and out of the line of fire\u201d. International pressure has risen for a lasting halt to the war. The White House said it was \u201cworking on it literally by the hour\u201d to try to extend the temporary ceasefire. Amid the latest release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a source close to Hamas, who asked not to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media, told AFP it was \u201cwilling to extend the truce\u201d. The source added: The mediators are currently making strong, intense and continuous efforts for an additional day in the truce and then working to extend it again for other days.\nUpdated at 01.06 CET\n30 Nov 2023 00.15 CET Israel frees 30 Palestinians from prisons The Israel Prison Service said early on Friday it had released 30 Palestinians from Israeli jails as part of the latest exchange for hostages under the truce deal with Hamas.
