Submitting...\nUkraine president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has admitted that his country\u2019s counter-offensive \u201cdid not achieve the desired results\u201d and his wife, Olena, told the BBC that her country is in \u201cmortal danger.\u201d\nAs the war extends into another winter, the Russian forces have taken the opportunity to dig in and have refortified their defences, planting miles of landmines, constructing huge trenches and replenishing its supply of drones.\nThere is no doubt that the war is entering a crucial phase and the reluctance of the West to supply Ukraine with the weapons and equipment it sorely needs could prove to be decisive. President Zelensky is aware that support for his country\u2019s war effort looks as though it might be on the wane and that the very same politicians who championed Ukraine\u2019s cause when the Russian invasion got underway are now distancing themselves from the calls for continued funding at the level needed to boost Ukraine\u2019s chances of achieving a satisfactory outcome.\nPutin and his appeasers are salivating over recent developments in the West knowing that if Russia emerges victorious, Nato will be kneecapped as a result of the failure to ensure that Putin should not be allowed to profit from his naked, illegal, aggressive action in invading Ukraine.\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\nAdvertisement Hide Ad\nHowever, all is not lost and there is still substantial support for Ukraine in the West, despite the efforts of some right-wing politicians and lawmakers to disrupt the pipeline of weapons and equipment. Speaking on Monday, US Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, said: \u201cDespite his crimes and despite his isolation, Putin still believes that he can outlast Ukraine and that he can outlast America, but he is wrong\u2026 America\u2019s commitments must be honoured.\u201d\nAs President Zelensky does the rounds in the USA meeting up with President Joe Biden and House of Representatives Speaker, Mike Johnson, as he renews his calls for continued assistance, Ukrainians will be holding their breath as they await the outcome of the budgetary hold ups. Such is the nature of politics, and it has long been anticipated that this stage might be reached and the West\u2019s resolve would be put to the test. Putin knows that the decisions made in the USA and the European Union will go a long way to determining the outcome of the war \u2013 but there is still a realistic chance that his ambitions will not be realised and that funding will soon be resumed.", "source_domain": "www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com", "text": null, "title": "West must not abandon Ukraine in its hour of need - Steve Cardownie", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/opinion/columnists/west-must-not-abandon-ukraine-in-its-hour-of-need-steve-cardownie-4442715"}
