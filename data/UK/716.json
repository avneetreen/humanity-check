Hours later she learned of the unprecedented attack by Hamas in southern Israel, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage, including her son.\nEliya Cohen, 27, was at the Supernova music festival with his girlfriend, Ziv, three miles from the Gaza border when Hamas militants attacked partygoers. At least 260 people were killed in the festival grounds in one of the deadliest attacks on Israel in decades. Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza in response has killed more than 15,000 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health authorities.\nCohen, 55, said: \u201cIt was a very bad dream, I didn\u2019t know what to do, I was in shock. I just sat in the chair and slapped my face to see if I\u2019m in the real world or if it\u2019s a dream.\u201d\nWithin hours of the alarms, Cohen received a phone call from Ziv\u2019s sister telling her of the attack. Ziv was missing but Eliya was said be OK, confirmed by a photograph of him in hospital. But an hour later she received a Facebook message from Eliya\u2019s high school friend asking if she knew that her son had been abducted.\nView image in fullscreen \u2018We miss his laugh\u2019: Eliya Cohen.\n\u201cThat was the message when I understood that something\u2019s wrong with Eliya,\u201d said Cohen. She was sent the same photo of her son, this time overlaid with Arabic text saying he was in Gaza.\n\u201cAt the first moment, I think it\u2019s fake. I tried to call all the hospitals in the south and when I had no answer from the hospital that Eliya is there, I understood that he\u2019s kidnapped,\u201d she recalled. Three days later, confirmation came from Israeli soldiers.\nAt the beginning of December, fighting resumed in Gaza after a temporary ceasefire expired, during which 80 Israeli hostages were released by Hamas in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. According to Gaza\u2019s health authorities, more than 1,200 Palestinians have been killed since the end of the ceasefire.\nOn Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson, R Adm Daniel Hagari, said Israel had not lost sight of its \u201ccritical mission\u201d to rescue the 138 hostages still in Gaza. They include 17 women and children, according to the Israeli army, which confirmed the death of five hostages.\nHagari said: \u201cOur intelligence has been monitoring the situation of our hostages and I can say with absolute certainty every minute in Hamas captivity endangers their lives. The Israel Defense Forces will do everything in its power to rescue our hostages and bring them home.\u201d\nOn the morning of 7 October, Eliya and Ziv ran as the alarm sounded at the festival. They made it to their car, later abandoning it to seek shelter with nearly 30 others near the Re\u2019im kibbutz. Hours later, two vans of Hamas militants arrived and opened fire on the group, Cohen was later told by Ziv, who survived.\n\u201cShe was under the bodies for three hours, she didn\u2019t move,\u201d said Cohen, who was told Eliya had been shot in the leg and fell on top the bodies. Ziv felt her boyfriend being pulled away, and later understood he had been abducted.\n\u201cWe miss him very much. We miss his laugh, he was full of life and we don\u2019t know anything about him,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cI just want to see him, to feel him, to smell him, to see that he\u2019s OK, that he\u2019s not hurt in his body and his soul.\u201d\nSince the attack, Cohen has stopped working in her job as an accountant, instead travelling to Washington and London to campaign for the release of her son and the other hostages. When asked if she would like the Israeli government to stop its offensive in Gaza, she declined to answer.\n\u201cWe hope and we know that the Israeli army is trying not to harm the hostages, of course, and the civilians in Gaza; [they] just want to clear terrorists from Gaza,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want my son home.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018I just want my son home\u2019: agony of hostage\u2019s family amid Gaza fighting", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/06/eliya-cohen-israel-hostage-family-agony-gaza-fighting"}
