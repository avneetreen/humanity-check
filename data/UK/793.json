Nobody in Israel was reported killed.\nIsrael said the truce had been broken by Hamas and could not be renewed because the group had failed to offer to release the remaining female hostages in Gaza. Eylon Levy, a government spokesperson, said: \u201cHaving chosen to hold on to our women, Hamas will now take the mother of all thumpings.\u201d\nHamas said some of the women asked for were Israeli soldiers, and that it had offered to hand over two other detainees plus the bodies of three members of the Bibas family it said had been killed by Israeli bombing, but this was rejected. In a statement, Hamas accused Israel of making a \u201cprior decision to resume its criminal aggression against the Gaza Strip\u201d.\nThe fighting ended a fragile seven-day truce during which 80 Israeli hostages and 24 foreign nationals were released by Gaza, while Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners from its jails. Limited humanitarian aid had gone into Gaza, as food, water and medicines remain desperately short.\nResidents of Khan Younis, in the south of the strip, reported that 10 homes were destroyed in a bomb attack on Friday, and film from Al Jazeera showed a devastated area near the city\u2019s refugee camp. Bombing was reported across Gaza, with Israel confirming it had attacked Khan Younis and Rafah farther south.\n\u201cI deeply regret that military operations have started again in Gaza,\u201d said Ant\u00f3nio Gutteres, the UN secretary general. \u201cI still hope that it will be possible to renew the pause that was established. The return to hostilities only shows how important it is to have a true humanitarian ceasefire.\u201d\nNegotiations were continuing to restart the truce with the release of more hostages, said the US and Qatar, who have been acting as brokers. There are 137 people still held hostage, 20 women and 117 men, many of whom are Israeli military personnel. Until now, Israel has offered a day of truce in return for every 10 people returned \u2013 and agreed to release 30 Palestinians it holds.\nIsrael\u2019s military said it was dividing the entirety of Gaza into dozens of numbered blocks as a prelude to demanding targeted local evacuations in the crowded south of the strip before attacking a highlighted area. It dropped leaflets on to Gaza with a QR code to a website with a map of all the areas and geolocating people within them.\nEarlier this week, Israeli military sources said they anticipated the next phase of the operation in Gaza to involve an attack on the south, and in particular Khan Younis, where Israel believes Hamas\u2019s leadership is based. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would call for the civilian population to relocate on a district-by-district basis before targeting the area with airstrikes and artillery, they added.\nHumanitarian groups said on Friday that a plan to divide and attack the south, where 2 million people were sheltering, risked stretching Gaza to breaking point. \u201cThere is fundamentally nowhere for people to go,\u201d said Danila Zizi, the Palestine country manager for the charity Humanity & Inclusion.\nDoctors in Gaza said that though some of the IDF strikes appeared precisely targeted to avoid hospitals or areas with big concentrations of civilians, some were not. Most dangerous was shelling or other retaliation by the IDF after the launch of rockets from Gaza, with many being fired from or near urban areas, the doctors said.\nCivilian casualties began arriving at the European hospital in Khan Younis, one of the few still functioning in Gaza, from mid-morning, with surgeons performing dozens of amputations and other operations throughout the day. Casualties included a two-year-old, whose legs had been smashed by shrapnel, and his older brother. The rest of the family had been killed, one surgeon said.\nOvernight, six more Israelis, some holding dual nationality, were released, hours after two women were freed. That brought the total of people freed on Thursday to eight, fewer than the 10 hostages a day the truce deal required Hamas to release. A source close to the militant group said it was counting two Russian-Israeli women released on Wednesday as part of the seventh batch.\nFighting began on 7 October when Hamas militants broke through Gaza\u2019s perimeter fence into Israel. About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the surprise attack, in their homes and at a music festival, and Hamas kidnapped about 240 people, according to Israeli authorities.\nIsrael vowed to eliminate Hamas in response and began an air and ground military campaign in Gaza that the Hamas government there says has killed more than 15,000 people, mostly civilians.\nThere are concerns that hostilities will restart on Israel\u2019s northern border, where Hezbollah observed a unilateral ceasefire over the last seven days. The Lebanon-based Islamist militia and political organisation was not party to the negotiations between Hamas and Israel.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel launches strikes on Gaza as fighting resumes after truce expires", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/01/israel-hamas-war-ceasefire-ends-fighting-resumes-gaza-palestine"}
