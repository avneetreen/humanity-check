Both extend across 3% of Cyprus\u2019s land mass, or 98 sq miles.\nAlthough never confirmed, EU diplomats in Nicosia, the island\u2019s war-split capital, say US forces are present on the military installation. \u201cIf you look over the fence at Akrotiri you\u2019ll see US military surveillance and other aircraft,\u201d one said.\nOn Tuesday, the Cyprus government\u2019s spokesperson, Konstantinos Letymbiotis, emphasised the eastern Mediterranean island was not involved in any military operations, intimating that under the bases\u2019 treaty of establishment, the UK was not obliged to inform Cypriot authorities about activity in the facilities. \u201cThe government is in constant communication with the UK within the framework established in relation to the bases\u2019 use,\u201d he said.\nProtests mounted last week after RAF Akrotiri was used as a launch pad for Typhoon fighter jets conducting targeted airstrikes on Houthi strongholds in Yemen in retaliation for attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The pro-Palestinian militia has justified its assaults \u2013 with one of its missiles recently hitting a Greek-owned cargo ship \u2013 by saying it was acting in response to Israel\u2019s ongoing offensive.\nIn an apparent attempt to calm nerves in Cyprus, the British defence minister, Grant Shapps, was on the island on Friday meeting the president. \u201cWe want to do everything possible to ensure the security of Cyprus, which is in everyone\u2019s best interests. We appreciate that you are in a difficult neighbourhood and want to do everything possible to make it easier,\u201d he said. The Houthis, he claimed, \u201cdo not pose an immediate threat to Cyprus\u201d.\nThe US and UK strikes have exacerbated concerns of the Israel-Gaza war becoming a wider regional conflagration. Washington and London have vowed to continue the airstrikes if necessary.\nCypriot activists say they are deeply concerned the British bases may also be used by the US and UK to send military aid to Israel, a claim neither country has confirmed.\nAt Sunday\u2019s protest, demonstrators chanted \u201cout with the bases of death\u201d outside the entrance of RAF Akrotiri, close to the coastal city of Limassol in the island\u2019s south.\n\u201cPut simply, we don\u2019t want our country to be used in a war that has left more than 24,000 dead, the vast majority women and children,\u201d said Costeas who presides over the Cyprus Peace Council, a bi-communal NGO that helped organise the rally. \u201cWe know what conflict means. Fifty years ago Cyprus was split by war.\u201d\nSince the start of the Gaza war following the 7 October incursion by Hamas militants that left about 1,200 people dead, witnesses have spoken of a sharp increase in the number of military transport planes making the 40-minute journey from Akrotiri to Tel Aviv.\nWithin weeks of the Hamas attack, Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper reported that \u201cmore than 40 US transport aircraft, 20 British transport aircraft and seven heavy transport helicopters [had] arrived at the British Akrotiri base on the island. They carried equipment, arms and forces.\u201d\nThe UK\u2019s defence ministry has denied it is using the facilities \u2013 which also serve a surveillance-gathering role as a station for signals intelligence \u2013 to help Israel with \u201clethal cargo\u201d. Instead, a defence ministry spokesperson sought at the weekend to highlight the EU member state\u2019s humanitarian role in the region.\n\u201cBritish Forces Cyprus continue to support the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza,\u201d the official said.\nActivists in Cyprus, however, believe US aircraft have sent weaponry to Israel via Cyprus from depots at its bases around Europe.\nAsked about the claims, a US department of defense spokesperson said: \u201cIt is our policy to not discuss specific details of military logistics, to include aircraft movements for security reasons. All US military activities are fully compliant with international law and are coordinated closely with our allies.\u201d\nCosteas, the peace activist, claimed there was evidence that spy planes were also operating out of Akrotiri. London and Washington have denied direct involvement in Israel\u2019s war but said they have launched drones from Cyprus to Gaza to help search for hostages.\nPresident Christodoulides has been vocal in his desire to use the island\u2019s proximity to Gaza to establish a maritime aid corridor between the port of Larnaca and the besieged coastal strip \u2013 a plan that, as yet, has not come to fruition, although a Royal Navy landing ship delivered 90 tons of air-freighted supplies bound for the Palestinian territory, via Egypt, last month.\nBoth Greek and Turkish Cypriot peace activists have joined forces to denounce the role of the bases, with the main leftist AKEL party urging the government to do more to ensure the island \u201chas no complicity in the bloodshed of Gaza\u201d.\n\u201cThe government of Cyprus should have done more to stop the bases being used in this way,\u201d said Vera Polycarpou, who heads AKEL\u2019s international relations. \u201cThere have been protests against the bases\u2019 presence here since 1964. It really is a joke, a sick joke, to hear that aid, and not weapons, are being carried by planes out of Akrotiri when all the evidence is to the contrary.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Cyprus faces backlash over use of British bases to bomb Houthis", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/20/cyprus-faces-backlash-over-use-of-british-bases-to-bomb-houthis"}
