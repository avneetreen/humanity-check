'We are advancing.'\nLater he told a group of troops: 'I want to make one thing clear \u2013 nothing will stop us. We will advance and win, and we will do so with God's help and the help of our heroic soldiers.'\nBenjamin Netanyahu speaks during a press conference with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz in the Kirya military base in Tel Aviv, Israel, Oct. 28, 2023\nSmoke rises following Israeli strikes in Tal Al Hawa neighborhood in Gaza City, 2 November\nMore than 9,000 Palestinians and at least 1,400 Israelis have been killed, according to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and the Palestinian health authority, since October 7\nPeople check buildings destroyed in an Israeli strike on the Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip on November 2\nThe prime minister also said that the government had not made any decision about transferring fuel to Gaza, despite desperate pleas from hospital chiefs there \u2013 even urging locals to donate a litre of fuel if they had it.\n'We haven't made any decision about transferring fuel. I haven't given any instruction and the war cabinet has not authorised any decision,' he told reporters.\nNetanyahu's comments came as Hamas' and their Iranian-backed allies in Lebanon, Hezbollah, fired their heaviest barrage of rockets since the war began at the northern Israeli border town of Kiryat Shmona, injuring two people.\nThe intensity of the combat in Gaza was illustrated by the loss of Israel's highest-ranking officer so far in the conflict, Lt Col. Salman Habaka, the 18th soldier to die since the beginning of the ground operation.\nTank commander Col Habaka, 33, a member of Israel's Druze Arab minority, was heavily involved in the fight against Hamas' murderous attack on October 7 which killed 1,400 people.
