The strike came as Israel said it would press on with its offensive to crush the territory's Hamas rulers, despite U.S. appeals for a pause to get aid to desperate civilians.\nThe soaring death toll in Gaza has sparked growing international anger, with tens of thousands from Washington to Berlin taking to the streets Saturday to demand an immediate cease-fire.\nIsrael has rejected the idea of halting its offensive, even for brief humanitarian pauses proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken during his current tour of the region. Instead, it said that the besieged enclave\u2019s Hamas rulers were \u201cencountering the full force\u201d of its troops.\n\u201cAnyone in Gaza City is risking their life,\u201d Israel\u2019s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said.\nLarge columns of smoke rose as Israel\u2019s military said it had encircled Gaza City, the initial target of its offensive against Hamas. Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry has said more than 9,400 Palestinians have been killed in the territory in nearly a month of war, and that number is likely to rise as the assault continues.\nEarly Sunday, airstrikes hit the Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least 33 people and wounding 42, said Ashraf al-Qidra, the spokesman for the Health Ministry.\nHe said first responders, aided by residents, were still searching the rubble for dead or possible survivors.\nThe camp is located in the evacuation zone where Israel\u2019s military had urged Palestinian civilians in Gaza to seek refuge as it focuses its military offensive in the northern areas.\nDespite such appeals, Israel has continued its bombardment across Gaza, saying it is targeting Hamas fighters and assets everywhere. It has accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields.\nCritics say Israel\u2019s strikes are often disproportionate, considering the large number of women and children killed in such attacks.\nBlinken met with Arab foreign ministers in Jordan on Saturday after talks in Israel with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who insisted there could be no temporary cease-fire until all hostages held by Hamas are released.\nJordan\u2019s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said Arab countries want an immediate cease-fire, saying \u201cthe whole region is sinking in a sea of hatred that will define generations to come.\u201d\nBlinken, however, said \u201cit is our view now that a cease-fire would simply leave Hamas in place, able to regroup and repeat what it did on Oct. 7.\u201d He said humanitarian pauses can be critical in protecting civilians, getting aid in and getting foreign nationals out, \"while still enabling Israel to achieve its objective, the defeat of Hamas.\u201d\nAs he left church in Delaware on Saturday, U.S. President Joe Biden hinted at progress in efforts to convince Israel to agree to a humanitarian pause, responding \u201cYes,\u201d to reporters\u2019 questions about any forward movement on the subject. He did not elaborate.\nSenior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told reporters in Beirut that Blinken \u201cshould stop the aggression and should not come up with ideas that cannot be implemented.\u201d The spokesman of the Hamas military wing, who goes by Abu Obeida, said in a speech that fighters had destroyed 24 Israeli vehicles and inflicted casualties in the past two days.\nEgyptian officials said they and Qatar were proposing humanitarian pauses for six to 12 hours daily to allow aid in and casualties to be evacuated. They were also asking for Israel to release a number of women and elderly prisoners in exchange for hostages, suggestions Israel seemed unlikely to accept. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the press on the discussions.\nIsrael has repeatedly demanded that northern Gaza\u2019s 1.1 million residents flee south, and on Saturday it offered a three-hour window for residents to do so. An Associated Press journalist on the road, however, saw nobody coming. The head of the government media office in Gaza, Salama Maarouf, said no one went south because the Israeli military had damaged the road.\nIsrael asserted that Hamas \u201cexploited\u201d the window to move south and attack its forces. There was no immediate Hamas comment on that claim, which was impossible to verify.\nSome Palestinians said they didn\u2019t flee because they feared Israeli bombardment.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t trust them,\u201d said Mohamed Abed, who sheltered with his wife and children on the grounds of al-Shifa hospital, one of thousands of Palestinians seeking safety at medical centers in the north.\nSwaths of residential neighborhoods in northern Gaza have been leveled in airstrikes. U.N. monitors say more than half of northern Gaza\u2019s remaining residents, estimated at around 300,000, are sheltering in U.N.-run facilities. But deadly Israeli strikes have also repeatedly hit and damaged those shelters. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees has said it has lost contact with many in the north.\nOn Saturday, two strikes hit a U.N. school sheltering thousands just north of Gaza City, killing several people in tents in the schoolyard and women who were baking bread inside the building, according to the U.N. agency. Initial reports indicated that 20 people were killed, said spokeswoman Juliette Touma. The health ministry in Gaza said 15 people were killed at the school and another 70 wounded.\nAlso Saturday, two people were killed in a strike by the gate of al-Nasser Hospital in Gaza City, according to Medhat Abbas, health ministry spokesman. And a strike hit near the entrance to the emergency ward of al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, injuring at least 21, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.\nThe World Health Organization called attacks on health care in Gaza \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\nAt least 1,115 Palestinian dual nationals and wounded have exited Gaza into Egypt, but on Saturday authorities in Gaza didn\u2019t allow foreign passport holders to leave because Israel was preventing the evacuation of Palestinian patients for treatment in Egypt, said Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority.\nThe U.N. said about 1.5 million people in Gaza, or 70% of the population, have fled their homes.\nFood, water and the fuel needed for generators that power hospitals and other facilities is running out.\nTurkey said it was recalling its ambassador to Israel for consultations, and Turkish media reported that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he could no longer speak to Netanyahu in light of the bombardment.\nThousands of Israelis protested outside Netanyahu\u2019s official residence in Jerusalem, urging him to resign and calling for the return of roughly 240 hostages held by Hamas. Netanyahu has refused to take responsibility for the Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel that killed more than 1,400 people.\n\"I find it difficult to understand why trucks with humanitarian aid are going to monsters,\u201d said Ella Ben Ami, whose parents were abducted. She called for aid to be halted until the hostages are released.\nThousands of people also joined a demonstration of hostages' families in Tel Aviv.\nAir raid sirens sounded Saturday evening in southern Israel as Hamas launched rockets into Ashkelon. Rocket fire has continued in the area throughout the conflict, forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate their homes.\nFears continued of a new front opening along Israel's border with Lebanon. The Israeli military said it had struck militant cells in Lebanon trying to fire at Israel, as well as an observation post for Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas. Throughout the war, Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire almost daily. Hezbollah and Israel fought a monthlong war in 2006 that ended in a tense stalemate.\n\u201cWe are not interested in a northern front, but we are prepared for any task,\u201d Gallant, Israel's defense minister, said after touring the border. He said the Air Force is \"preserving most of its might for the Lebanon front,\u201d according to a video statement.\nAmong the Palestinians killed in Gaza are more than 3,900 Palestinian children, the Gaza Health Ministry said, without providing a breakdown of civilians and fighters.\nThe Israeli military said four more soldiers have died during the Gaza ground operation, bringing the confirmed death toll to 28.\n___\nMroue reported from Beirut and Anna reported from New York.
