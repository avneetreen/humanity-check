Journalists are being killed in the Israel-Hamas war at the rate of more than one every day since 7 October \u2013 at least 53 so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ.\nThis has been the deadliest period for journalists in the 30 years since the New York-based organization began keeping these dire statistics.\nBut, of course, it\u2019s not all about the numbers.\nThere\u2019s also the reality that the loss of journalists translates into less information. And that lies and propaganda love a void.\nAnd, of course, there are the people themselves. Each with a life, a career, a family, hopes and a mission \u2013 now cut short.\nIt may help understanding to name some of the victims. According to CPJ, they include people like Roshdi Sarraj, a journalist and co-founder of Ain Media, a Palestinian company, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza.\nOr the Israeli journalist Roee Idan, a photographer for the newspaper Ynet. He and his wife were killed in the Hamas attack on 7 October. He was working when he died. His four-year-old daughter, held hostage by Hamas for seven weeks, was released on Sunday.\nOr Issam Abdallah, a Beirut-based videographer for Reuters, the international news agency, who was killed near the Lebanon border while documenting the shelling between Israeli forces and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.\n\u201cThe world needs to know what is going on,\u201d but that\u2019s getting harder all the time, Clayton Weimers, the executive director of RSF (the international organization also known as Reporters Without Borders), recently said.\nRSF\u2019s representatives, in a meeting at the White House this week, urged Joe Biden to do more to support journalists.\nThe overwhelming majority of the dead appear to be Palestinian journalists killed in Israeli airstrikes. As of Monday, the CPJ reports that of the 57 journalists and media workers known to have died during the current war, 50 were Palestinian, four Israeli and three Lebanese.\nRSF has pleaded with the Biden administration to put more pressure on the Israeli government to protect civilian lives, including those of journalists. RSF also objected to the difficulty of getting necessary supplies \u2013 chargers, phones and camera equipment \u2013 to those working in Gaza.\n\u201cMeanwhile, the journalists in Gaza cannot leave, and the only outside media permitted to enter have been invited to embed with the Israeli Defense Forces and submit to strict rules controlling what they can see and share,\u201d the organization said in a statement.\nWhile this embedded coverage is valuable, RSF notes, \u201cit is no substitute for independent reporting\u201d.\nEspecially painful to the broader journalism world is the loss of Belal Jadallah, the press freedom defender who made an important contribution to a CPJ report published in May, \u201cDeadly Pattern\u201d. It revealed a complete lack of accountability in Israeli military killings of journalists over the past two decades.\n\u201cHis killing leaves a gaping hole in the media landscape in Gaza,\u201d said Sherif Mansour, who coordinates CPJ\u2019s Middle East programs.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Follow Margaret Sullivan Free newsletter Sign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.

It publishes guidelines for reporting in conflict zones and for treating the physical and psychological trauma that often follows.\nPerhaps most importantly, it raises awareness about what\u2019s happening \u2013 and what goes missing when journalists are killed.\nJodie Ginsberg, the organization\u2019s president, said in an interview on Sunday that due to the extreme dangers since the first week of October, \u201cthere was not a single international journalist working in Gaza\u201d until very recent days.\nThat meant that nearly all the information getting to the world from inside Gaza was coming from Palestinian journalists \u2013 those who have apparently been targeted, or at least not protected.\nCPJ has joined the calls for a humanitarian ceasefire to spare civilians.\n\u201cJournalists are civilians \u2013 it\u2019s really important to remember that,\u201d Ginsberg told Canada\u2019s CBC News. \u201cThey have a vital role to play in any war and they need to be protected.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s not happening. The price is steep for individuals, for news organizations and for truth itself.\nAt the moment, Ginsberg said, journalists remain in serious peril and the numbers continue to mount.\n\u201cNowhere in Gaza is safe.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "The Israel-Hamas war is deadly for journalists.
