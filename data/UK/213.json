We will not weaken. That is the message that I am carrying here to the Ukrainians. Our determination is intact,\u201d S\u00e9journ\u00e9 said.\nThe ministers took no questions.\nFrance has been switching away from its initial post-invasion policy of providing complete weapons systems to Ukraine from its own stocks. It is increasingly pursuing what the government describes as a more sustainable effort to help defense manufacturers \u2014 both at home and in Ukraine \u2014 ramp up production so they can supply the embattled country's long-term armament needs.\nS\u00e9journ\u00e9 said that a French defense fund to enable Ukraine to buy armaments also got fresh funding in recent weeks but he did not specify the amount.\nFrance is also working to overcome objections from Hungary to supply EU financial aid to Ukraine, needed to fund essential public services and reconstruction. S\u00e9journ\u00e9 said France would use \u201call of its weight\u201d to try to unblock the EU aid package at an upcoming summit in early February.\nKuleba thanked S\u00e9journ\u00e9 for not being deterred from visiting by \u201canother massive Russian strike.\u201d\nHe also highlighted that many Western-made components were found in Russian missiles used to attack Ukraine.\n\u201cAccording to a recent report by the Kyiv School of Economics and Yermak McFaul\u2019s group, 44% of all electronic components in Russia\u2019s weapons are developed by Western companies,\u201d he said, calling on the Group of Seven and the European Union to \u201ctake decisive measures to block the supply of goods containing these components to Russia.\u201d\nS\u00e9journ\u00e9 \u2019s visit came a day after British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak unveiled Friday new military funding for Ukraine, announcing a security pact with Kyiv and 2.5 billion pounds (about $3.2 billion) for its war effort over the next fiscal year.\nAlso on Saturday, the Ukrainian Air Force said its defense system downed eight of the 37 missiles fired by Russia. Three drones were also launched. The air force said via its Telegram channel that more than 20 of the total attacks were prevented from reaching their target \u201cby means of electronic warfare.\u201d\nBoth Ukraine and Russia make use of electronic warfare technology aimed at jamming and diverting enemy drones and guided missiles.\nAlso, in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Sumy region, a resident was wounded as a result of a morning rocket attack, the regional prosecutor\u2019s office said.\nIn Russia, a local resident received shrapnel wounds when Ukrainian forces attacked a village in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov.\n___\nAssociated Press writer John Leicester in Paris and Elise Morton in London contributed.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "French foreign minister visits Kyiv and pledges solidarity as Russia launches attacks", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ukraine-ap-kyiv-russia-french-b2478197.html"}
