And that\u2019s why [Nato forces] are preparing for a conflict with Russia,\u201d Admiral Bauer, a Dutch naval officer who chairs the Nato Military Committee, said. He warned that a large number of civilians will have to be mobilised if a wider war breaks out in Europe and the process of recruiting much larger reserve forces should be put in place by governments now.\n\u201cThe discussion is much wider... people that have to understand they play a role... The realisation that not everything is plannable and not everything is going to be hunky dory in the next 20 years.\u201d\nUkrainian soldiers on the eastern frontline against Russia\u2019s forces (AP)\nAdmiral Bauer was speaking after a committee meeting in Brussels. It comes with Nato set to launch its biggest military exercises in decades next week. Around 90,000 personnel are set to take part in months of drills aimed at showing the alliance can defend all of its territories up to the Russian border.\nThe admiral praised Sweden for asking all of its citizens to brace for war ahead of the country formally joining the alliance. Stockholm\u2019s move, announced earlier this month, has led to a surge in volunteers for the country\u2019s civil defence organisation and a spike in sales of torches and battery-powered radios.\nCarl-Oskar Bohlin, Sweden\u2019s minister for civil defence, had told a security conference that \u201cwar could come to Sweden\u201d. The commander-in-chief, Micael Byd\u00e9n, then warned the same gathering that \u201cRussia\u2019s war against Ukraine is just a step, not an end game\u201d.\n\u201cWe need to realise how serious the situation really is, and that everyone, individually, need to prepare themselves mentally,\u201d he said. Opposition politicians accused the government of seeking to play up the threat of war for political gain.\nIn his interview with Der Tagesspiegel, Mr Pistorius said the Swedish warnings were \u201cunderstandable from a Scandinavian perspective\u201d, adding that Sweden faced \u201can even more serious situation\u201d, given how close it is to Russia. Stockholm has applied to join Nato but is waiting for approval from Turkey and Hungary to join. Finland was approved last year.\n\u201cWe also have to learn to live with danger again and prepare ourselves \u2013 militarily, socially and in terms of civil defence,\u201d Mr Pistorius warned.\nStockpiles of weapons and ammunition have been drained across Europe, the US and beyond in supporting the defence of Ukraine, and will take years to replenish at the current rate of production.\n\u201cWe need to be readier across the whole spectrum,\u201d Admiral Bauer said. \u201cYou have to have a system in place to find more people if it comes to war, whether it does or not. Then you talk mobilisation, reservists or conscription.\n\u201cYou need to be able to fall back on an industrial base that is able to produce weapons and ammunition fast enough to be able to continue a conflict if you are in it.\u201d\nThe Nato exercises next week \u2013 dubbed Steadfast Defender 24 \u2013 \u201cwill show that Nato can conduct and sustain complex multi-domain operations over several months, across thousands of kilometres, from the high north to central and eastern Europe, and in any condition,\u201d a statement from the 31-member organisation said.\nTroops will be moving to and through Europe until the end of May in what is described as \u201ca simulated emerging conflict scenario with a near-peer adversary\u201d \u2013 essentially Russia.\n\u201cThe alliance will demonstrate its ability to reinforce the Euro-Atlantic area via transatlantic movement of forces from North America,\u201d Nato\u2019s supreme allied commander, US General Christopher Cavoli, said earlier this week. General Cavoli said it will demonstrate \u201cour unity, our strength, and our determination to protect each other\u201d.\nBritain\u2019s defence secretary, Grant Shapps, has said that the UK will send 20,000 troops backed by advanced fighter jets, surveillance planes, warships and submarines, to take part in the exercises \u2013 with many being deployed in eastern Europe from February to June.\nA day earlier, Admiral Bauer said the alliance needed a \u201cwarfighting transformation\u201d and asked the public and private actors in the West to gear up for an era in which anything could happen at any time, including fighting a war.\nNato governments and companies should adjust their thinking to \u201can era in which anything can happen at any time, an era in which we need to expect the unexpected, an era in which we need to focus on effectiveness in order to be fully effective\u201d, he said.\nAdmiral Bauer also pledged the alliance\u2019s backing for Ukraine and said that the nation facing a Russian invasion \u201cwill have our support for every day that is to come, because the outcome of this war will determine the fate of the world\u201d.\nNato as an organisation is not directly involved in the conflict, except to supply Kyiv with non-lethal support, although many member countries send weapons and ammunition individually or in groups, and provide military training.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Germany warns Putin could launch attack on Nato in less than a decade", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/nato-war-with-russia-admiral-bauer-b2481278.html"}
