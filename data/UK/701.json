The IDF, meanwhile, has not ruled out bombing the area, claiming that rockets were fired from there, most recently on Wednesday.\nAl-Mawasi was first touted as a safe zone a few days after the bombardment of Gaza began in response to the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel in which 1,200 were killed.\nHowever, the IDF has been inconsistent in recommending al-Mawasi as a safe space.\nMaps and instructions distributed recently to the 2.3 million Palestinians trapped in Gaza show the territory divided into 623 numbered districts, with orange arrows showing how civilians should move from one district to another to avoid planned IDF military operations.\nThe arrows have changed direction as circumstances have changed in the past few days, but none of them specifically pointed towards al-Mawasi, nor was the 14 sq km coastal area mentioned in the accompanying text.\nAl-Mawasi was however shown in a presentation by the IDF to the international press on Thursday. It appeared as a grey area on a map of southern Gaza, labelled as a \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d.\nAsked to give details, Col Elad Goren, the head of the civil department of the IDF\u2019s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (Cogat) branch, confirmed the army was recommending it as a haven for Gazans fleeing the war. He also suggested that Israeli forces were putting themselves in danger by allowing the zone to exist, the implication being that it could be used by Hamas to launch attacks.\nGoren said: \u201cThere are risks, but still we understand that the population needs a solution, so we want to encourage the population to go to this humanitarian zone where assistance will be delivered.\u201d\nGazans who have heeded that advice have described al-Mawasi as dangerously overcrowded and desolate. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s horrible,\u201d said one man who had fled Jarara, north of Khan Younis, a week ago.\n\u201cWe believed that al-Mawasi was a safe place, as this is what the Israeli forces told us,\u201d the man said in a recorded voice message, in which the buzz of overhead drones was clearly audible.\nThe women and girls in his family found a room in a shelter that they were sharing with other families, while the men slept outside in the cold.\n\u201cOf course, we barely find food, or anything to eat and drink,\u201d the man said. He added that there was a weekly aid delivery, but it was not nearly sufficient for the crowds that had gathered at al-Mawasi.\n\u201cThis food in a normal situation wouldn\u2019t be enough for an average family of seven to eight people, but now in this place where we live, there are almost 60 or 70 people, so we struggle. I have to give some part of my food to my son and my wife.\u201d\nPictures of al-Mawasi published by Sky News showed flimsy improvised shelters erected over an expanse of sand strewn with rubbish.\n\u201cIt is not possible to concentrate large numbers of civilians in such tiny slivers of land without exacerbating an already dire humanitarian catastrophe,\u201d Alexandra Saieh, the head of humanitarian policy at Save the Children International, warned. \u201cPeople are in overcrowded shelters in makeshift tents. There is no access to clean water, there are crumbling sanitation facilities. We\u2019ve heard of children starving in the so-called \u2018safe zone\u2019 of al-Mawasi.\u201d\nThe UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said in a statement: \u201cThe UN is not involved in this and has underlined repeatedly that unilaterally declared \u2018safe zones\u2019 are not safe at all. Nowhere in Gaza is safe.\u201d\nThe IDF itself refuses to rule out bombing or other military operations in al-Mawasi, alleging that 12 rockets were launched from the al-Mawasi area on Wednesday.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the words \u2018safe place\u2019 or \u2018safe haven\u2019 because Hamas fired a rocket from al-Mawasi,\u201d an IDF officer said. \u201cHamas is using this place for human shields, for its own needs.\u201d\nThis officer recommended instead that Gazans follow the official map and evacuation instructions, regularly distributed by leaflets, phone texts and social media messages. He said: \u201cThose are changed in accordance to the situation assessment.\u201d\nThe map accompanying these instructions dividing Gaza into 623 blocks is taken from an Israeli blueprint from the 1970s, Haaretz reported, and was part of a short-lived plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip under Israeli occupation.\nThe instructions list the names and grid numbers of the districts to be evacuated and those where Gazans are supposed to seek shelter. \u201cDear residents of Gaza, obeying evacuation instructions is the safest way to preserve your safety, your lives, and the lives of your families,\u201d the IDF text says.\n00:01:40 Collapse in humanitarian relief after Israeli forces advance on southern Gaza \u2013 video report\nThe UN and aid agencies have said that such instructions only add to the peril Gazans face, as movement anywhere is dangerous amid intense urban combat, especially as humanitarian deliveries have completely broken down, creating conditions described by the UN\u2019s top aid official as \u201capocalyptic\u201d.\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s safe zones within Gaza are a mirage,\u201d Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam\u2019s head of policy for the occupied Palestinian territories, said. \u201cThey\u2019re unprotected, they\u2019re not provisioned and they\u2019re inaccessible.\u201d\nMatthew Miller, the state department spokesperson, said this week that the US was \u201cworking with UNRWA to try to identify sites where civilians can go to be safe from harm\u201d.\nUNRWA responded in a statement on Thursday: \u201cUNRWA does not have any plans to provide assistance in a \u2018safe zone\u2019 but is looking for options for more shelters within the city \u2013 not new camps \u2013 as its own shelters are overcrowded now.\n\u201cAs with all its premises, it will share the coordinates with the parties to the conflict, both Israeli authorities and de facto authorities \u2026 Some 80 UNRWA premises were already hit during the fighting \u2013 some directly.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "IDF instructions on Gaza refuge zones cruel \u2018mirage\u2019, say aid agencies", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/07/idf-israel-gaza-refuge-zones-cruel-mirage-say-aid-agencies"}
