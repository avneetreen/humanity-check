Honestly, I couldn\u2019t feel them,\u201d said 26-year-old Sondos.\n\u201cI was transferred to the operating room for my legs because bones were shattered. After that, thank God, I gave birth to a girl. I will name her Habiba al-Rahman, after her sister who was martyred on the same day.\u201d\nThe outbreak of secondary infections continues without clean water and antimicrobial drugs.\n\u201cWe have a health disaster. We have a type of worm, called white flies, covering the wounds after the surgery. They appear after one day,\u201d said Dr Abusada.\n\u201cMost injuries and surgeries have no follow-ups as the medical teams cannot cope with the influx of injuries every hour.\u201d\nCalling the situation \u201cdisastrous\u201d, he said that the wards have \u201czero\u201d space left for patients.\n\u201cOn a normal day, we have a capacity of 210 beds, and now we have more than 800 patients that need to be admitted.\u201d\nAs night settled over Gaza on Friday, there was no sign of a let up in the fighting around the hospitals.\nPalestinian sources report that there is a heavy exchange of fire in Al-Quds Hospital area in Gaza City. The Red Crescent reported one dead and 20 wounded, including two seriously, from IDF fire.\nThere were also calls for the IDF to make greater efforts to reduce civilian deaths.\nSpeaking in New Delhi at the end of an intense nine-day diplomatic tour of the Middle East and Asia, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said on Friday that the US \u201cappreciates\u201d Israel\u2019s formalisation of pauses in their military operations to allow Palestinians to move south and its creation of a second safe corridor for them to use to escape harm but that more needed to be done.\nMr Blinken added that Israel\u2019s steps \u201cwill save lives and will enable more assistance to get to Palestinians in need\u201d, but at the same time \u201dmuch more needs to be done to protect civilians and to make sure that humanitarian assistance reaches them\u201d.\nHe said \u201cfar too many Palestinians have been killed, far too many have suffered these past weeks\u201d and that everything possible should be done to prevent harm and maximise the assistance they need.\nMargaret Harris, a World Health Organisation spokesman, said on Friday that Al-Shifa hospital had been \u201ccoming under bombardment\u201d, adding that 20 hospitals in Gaza were now out of action entirely.\nAsked about the Gaza health ministry\u2019s allegation of an Israeli strike on the hospital courtyard, Ms Harris said: \u201cI haven\u2019t got the details on Al-Shifa, but we do know they are coming under bombardment.\u201d Asked to elaborate, she said there was \u201cintense violence\u201d at the site, quoting colleagues on the ground.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "\u2018I told Israel, I cannot move my patients or they will die\u2019", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/11/10/israel-gaza-dispatch-hospitals-al-shifa-hamas-tunnels/"}
