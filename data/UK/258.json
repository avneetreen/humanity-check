Thank you for reading.\nUpdated at 01.21 CET\n9 Jan 2024 00.22 CET The US has defended its veto last month of a UN security council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, saying the proposal was \u201cdisconnected from the situation on the ground\u201d. The Associated Press reports that a UN general assembly meeting on Tuesday, the Palestinian and Arab delegations were joined by many other countries as they demanded an immediate halt to the fighting \u2013 calls that were echoed by a group of anti-war rabbis in the gallery. US deputy ambassador Robert Wood repeated that Washington was working to secure a \u201cpause\u201d in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of 136 Israeli hostages in Gaza. He said it was \u201cstriking\u201d that those urging an end to the conflict had made very few demands of Hamas, whose 7 October attack on southern Israel sparked the war.

A ceasefire would be \u201ca victory for Hamas \u2026 to continue the reign of terror in Gaza\u201d, said Israel\u2019s UN ambassador, Gilad Erdan. He said Israel supported delivering aid to Gaza but accused Hamas of \u201clooting\u201d humanitarian assistance before it got to civilians. He also accused the UN of doing \u201cnothing\u201d to bring the hostages home. About 36 rabbis from the group Rabbis 4 Ceasefire, which opposes Israel\u2019s ongoing military action, came to the UN as tourists. The majority of them briefly held signs in the empty security council chamber saying \u201cBiden Stop Vetoing Peace\u201d. A small group did the same in the gallery of the general assembly chamber before being hustled out by UN security officers. Riyad Mansour, the UN Palestinian ambassador, told the assembly his people were \u201cbeing slaughtered\u201d, with entire families killed, and stressed that \u201cthe horrors need to end, and the only way to end them is a ceasefire\u201d.
