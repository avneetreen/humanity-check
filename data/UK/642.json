China claims virtually the entire strategic waterway, but the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also pressed their separate claims.\nTerritorial standoffs between China and the Philippines over a number of disputed offshore areas, including the Scarborough and the Second Thomas shoals, have been particularly heated this year. The U.S. has warned that it\u2019s obligated to defend the Philippines, its longtime treaty ally, if Filipino forces, aircraft or ships come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea.\nChina has warned the U.S. to stay away from what it calls a purely Asian dispute. It has deployed ships and aircraft to closely shadow U.S. Navy ships and aircraft, which periodically undertake freedom of navigation and overflight patrols in one of the world\u2019s most hotly disputed seas.\nA Philippine government task force that deals with the long-seething territorial disputes said Saturday it \u201cvehemently condemns the illegal and aggressive actions carried out by the Chinese coast guard and Chinese maritime militia against the civilian Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources vessels.\"\n\u201cWe demand that the Chinese government take immediate action to halt these aggressive activities and uphold the principles of international law and desist from actions that would infringe on Philippine sovereignty and endanger the lives and livelihood of Filipino fishermen,\u201d it said.\nU.S. Ambassador to Manila MaryKay Carlson condemned China\u2019s \u201caggressive, illegal actions.\"\n\u201cThis (Chinese) behavior violates international law and endangers lives and livelihood,\u201d Carlson said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cWe stand with our Philippine friends, partners, allies in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d\nThe Chinese coast guard said in a single sentence announcement on its website that it \u201cimplemented control measures in line with the law\u201d Saturday against three BFAR vessels that \u201cintruded into waters adjacent to Huangyan Island,\u201d the Chinese name for the Shoal.\nSeparately, the coast guard said it had \u201cimplemented controls in accordance with laws and regulations\u201d on Sunday against two Philippine coast guard vessels, including one official ship and one supply ship that were attempting to transport construction materials to the Second Thomas Shoal.\nChina has long sought to blockade the submerged reef, where a small contingent of Filipino marines has stood guard for years aboard a long-marooned but still actively commissioned warship, the BRP Sierra Madre.\nThe statement gave no details about the measures taken, but said the Philippines action \u201cseriously infringed on China\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d\nPhilippine fisheries bureau's ships had sailed to the Scarborough Shoal to provide humanitarian aid, mainly free fuel and Christmas grocery packs, to poor Filipino fishermen aboard nearly 30 boats in the rich but far-flung fishing area, Philippine officials said.\nThey said the swarm of Chinese coast guard and accompanying ships took dangerously aggressive actions, including the use of water cannons at least eight times, as the Philippine government ships approached about 2.6 kilometers to 3.5 kilometers (1.6 to 2 miles) from Scarborough Shoal.\nThey added that the Chinese coast guard installed a floating barrier at an entrance to the vast fishing lagoon of Scarborough Shoal and deployed personnel aboard small motor boats to drive away Filipino fishermen waiting for the distribution of fuel and food supplies at sea.\n\"To prevent the distribution of humanitarian support is not only illegal but also inhumane,\u201d the Philippine government task force said.\nIn past faceoffs in the high seas off disputed shoals, the Chinese coast guard has used a military-grade laser that caused Filipino crewmen temporary blindness, and resorted to dangerous blocking and shadowing maneuvers, including one that caused minor collisions.\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has allowed a larger U.S. military presence in local military bases under a 2014 defense pact partly to strengthen territorial defense amid China\u2019s increasingly aggressive actions in the disputed waters. China has strongly opposed and expressed alarm over increasing deployments of U.S. forces, warning that it would threaten regional peace and stability.\nThe Philippines has also launched joint sea and air patrols separately with the U.S. and Australia, and plans to expand this to a multilateral patrol, possibly including Japan and other like-minded nations to deter aggression in the South China Sea, National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano told reporters last week.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "US and Philippines condemn the Chinese coast guard's water cannon blasts on fisheries vessels", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/chinese-ap-philippines-scarborough-shoal-manila-b2461482.html"}
