Israel has received a list of hostages who are expected to be released by Hamas on Saturday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office says.\nThirty-nine Palestinian prisoners were released by Israel on Friday evening. They consisted of 24 women, including some convicted of attempted murder for attacks on Israeli forces, and 15 teenagers jailed for offences such as throwing stones. Celebrations have been taking place in the occupied West Bank following their release.\nThe hostage release came as part of a deal that has brought about a temporary pause in hostilities , with the four-day ceasefire marking the first break in seven weeks of war in Gaza. Under the agreement, Hamas is due to free at least 50 of the about 240 mostly Israeli hostages it has held since launching attacks into southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed.

Schneider Children\u2019s hospital, where four women and four child hostages were released, said doctors had conducted a preliminary examination and said they were all in in good physical condition.\nSome 137 trucks of goods were offloaded by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reception point in the Gaza Strip on Friday. The UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said it was \u201cthe biggest humanitarian convoy received\u201d in Gaza since 7 October.

Doron Spielman said: We are currently moving forward with... questioning him over the fact that he was the head of a hospital that was really sitting on top of an entire terror network. How could he not know what\u2019s happening? We have hostages that were on, you know, CCTV in his hospital. The Israeli army, which raided the hospital last week, has alleged Hamas fighters used a tunnel complex beneath the facility. Hamas and hospital officials have repeatedly denied the claims.

Deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan said: This sets out that anyone who is racist or incites hatred against any group should expect to be arrested. As should anyone who supports Hamas or any other banned organisation. Organisers Stop the War coalition said such a measure was \u201cintrusive\u201d but asked anyone attending to avoid \u201cany actions that might leave you or others around you open to arrest\u201d. The afternoon will also see a protest by Hizb-ut-Tahrir outside the Egyptian embassy. It is the first by the group since 21 October, after a video emerged showing a man chanting \u201cjihad\u201d, prompting an outcry from politicians. A march organised by the charity Campaign Against Antisemitism is also due to take place on Sunday, with about 40,000 to 50,000 people expected to attend.\nUpdated at 03.15 CET\n25 Nov 2023 02.56 CET London police on high alert over major pro-Palestinian protest Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are expected to gather in London for the latest demonstration calling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

About 100,000 people are expected to march on Saturday from Park Lane to Whitehall, as organisers rejected the label of \u201chate march\u201d deployed by Braverman before she was sacked by prime minister Rishi Sunak.

A man beside a road in Khan Younis, in the territory\u2019s south, says in the video, posted on X (formerly Twitter): They didn\u2019t let us go back to Gaza City to see our children.

That\u2019s a human thing,\u201d said Yoni Katz Asher, whose wife Doron and children Raz and Aviv were freed on Friday. But I am not celebrating, I will not celebrate until the last of the hostages returns home. Doron Katz Asher in an undated photo.

For the moment, the hostages are being kept away from the media while their condition is assessed. And for those whose relatives have not come home, the wait continues in a conflicting swirl of feelings. \u201cThe emotions are mixed emotions,\u201d said Shelly Shem Tov, the mother Omer Shem Tov, 21, who had attended the outdoor Supernova dance festival that was targeted in the attack and was among those taken hostage. He was not among those released on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m excited for the families who today are going to hug their loved ones,\u201d she said in an interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 12. I am jealous. And I am sad. Mostly sad that Omer is still not coming home.

Yaxley-Lennon, who uses the name Tommy Robinson, has claimed to support the aims of the march through central London due to be held this Sunday. Organisers say it will be the biggest protest against anti-Jewish hatred since the 1936 Cable Street protests against Oswald Mosley\u2019s blackshirts. Britain\u2019s Jewish communities have suffered a large rise in antisemitism since the Middle East exploded into crisis after the Hamas attacks against Israel on 7 October. Police said up to 50,000 people were expected at Sunday\u2019s march. A spokesperson for Campaign Against Antisemitism said: Contrary to what Tommy Robinson appears to believe, the drunken far-right thugs who came to \u2018protect the Cenotaph\u2019 on Armistice Day, some of whom shouted \u2018sieg heil\u2019 or hospitalised police officers, are not allies of the Jewish community and are not welcome at our solidarity march on Sunday 26 November. We look forward to seeing those who genuinely support our community and invite all of our allies to join us and march shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with British Jews. On 11 November, Armistice Day, Robinson supporters were among those who attacked police after claiming to be protecting war monuments from pro-Palestine marchers. The Met deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan said: Having spoken to the Campaign Against Antisemitism, Tommy Robinson is not welcome at the march on Sunday. Police said they were aware that Robinson might try to attend posing as a reporter.\n24 Nov 2023 00.33 CET WHO 'extremely concerned' about safety of patients at al-Shifa after hospital director arrested The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about the safety of the estimated 100 patients and health worker remaining at Gaza\u2019s al-Shifa hospital. In a statement published today, the WHO said it did not \u201chave information about the well-being\u201d of four health workers who have been arrested, including the director of al-Shifa hospital. On Thursday, Mohammad abu Salmiya and other medics were reportedly arrested by members of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) as they were travelling with a WHO evacuation convoy. The WHO said it participated in a \u201chigh-risk mission\u201d on Wednesday, in cooperation with the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), to transfer 151 patients, relatives and health workers from al-Shifa. During the screening process by members of the IDF, three medical personnel from the PRCS and three from the health ministry were detained, it said. The statement continued: Two of the six detained health workers have reportedly been released. We do not have information about the well-being of the four remaining health staff, including the director of Al-Shifa hospital. WHO calls for their legal and human rights to be fully observed during their detention. The IDF has confirmed Abu Salmiya had been arrested and transferred to the Shin Bet domestic security service for further questioning. It said that al-Shifa \u201cunder his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control centre\u201d and that Hamas fighters had sought refuge in the hospital.\n24 Nov 2023 00.03 CET Joe Biden says he expects \"dozens more hostages, including Americans\" will be released The US president has said he expects American citizens to be among the hostages who will be released.

Asked what his expectations were, Biden said \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it will take,\u201d adding: My expectation and hope is that as we move forward, the rest of the Arab world and the region is also putting pressure on all sides to slow this down, to bring this to an end as quickly as we can. He also said that conditioning military aid to Israel was a \u201cworthwhile thought, but I don\u2019t think if I started off with that we would have ever gotten where we are today\u201d, AP reported.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel-Hamas war: Biggest aid convoy since start of war enters Gaza - as it happened", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/nov/24/israel-hamas-war-live-ceasefire-set-to-begin-on-friday-morning-with-hostage-release-due-shortly-after"}
