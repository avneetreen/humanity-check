Hamas blamed Israel for the attack. The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nView image in fullscreen Displaced Palestinians hold out empty containers as they wait to receive food aid in the Rafah refugee camp on Friday. Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPA\nOn Thursday, Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, fanned the flames with a post on X accusing Qatar of being responsible for the 7 October Hamas attack, calling the Gulf state the \u201cpatron of Hamas\u201d and \u201ca country that supports terrorism and finances terrorism\u201d.\nAnsari\u2019s statement came in response to recordings of Netanyahu\u2019s closed-door meeting with family members of hostages earlier this week obtained by Israel\u2019s Channel 12, in which he reportedly said Qatar\u2019s role in the mediation process was \u201cproblematic\u201d.\nThe prime minister allegedly told the relatives he had intentionally not thanked Doha for its efforts to date and that he had expressed anger towards the US, Israel\u2019s most important ally, for deciding to keep a military base in the semi-democratic oil state.\n\u201cQatar in my opinion is no different, in essence, from the UN. It is no different, in essence, from the Red Cross, and in some ways it is even more problematic,\u201d he said. \u201cI am prepared to use any actor at the moment that will help me get [the hostages] home. I haven\u2019t any illusions about [Qatar]. They have leverage.\u201d\nIsrael has long maintained that international organisations such as the UN are biased against it. Doha in recent years has carved out a role as international mediator in conflicts such as Ukraine, Sudan and Afghanistan, as well as in previous rounds of fighting in Gaza. It has deep ties to Hamas and hosts several members of its political wing.\nQatar, along with Egypt and the US, has served as a leading mediator in the three-month war in Gaza sparked by Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel in which 1,140 people were killed and about 250 taken hostage. Israel\u2019s offensive, which it says will completely eradicate the Palestinian militant group, has killed more than 25,700 people and displaced about 85% of the strip\u2019s 2.3 million population from their homes.\nQatar was critical in securing a week-long truce in November in which more than 100 hostages were released in return for 240 women and children held in Israeli jails.\nNumerous rounds of negotiations have since faltered. The current deal under review is believed to include a 30-day pause in fighting, during which the remaining Israeli hostages would be freed in several instalments, but the parties are far from agreeing more permanent steps to end the conflict.\nRecent diplomatic efforts have been overshadowed by the heaviest fighting in Gaza this year, centred on the southern city of Khan Younis, which the Israeli army said on Wednesday it had \u201cencircled\u201d after two days of airstrikes and fierce ground fighting.\nKhan Younis\u2019s three hospitals had been cut off by the fighting, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and the Palestine Red Crescent said. On Wednesday, a centre in the city run by the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, where about 800 people had sought shelter, was hit by shelling, according to the agency\u2019s director. Twelve people were killed and 75 injured, with medical teams unable to access the building.\nIsrael denied its forces were responsible for the attack.\nSupport for the war remains high among Israelis, but opinion polls show lagging support for Netanyahu and his far-right coalition. Weekly Saturday night rallies demanding the release of hostages have been supplemented in recent weeks by growing calls for elections.\nTuesday\u2019s killing of 21 Israeli soldiers who were mining buildings for demolition and were hit by grenade fire \u2013 the deadliest single incident for Israeli forces in the conflict to date \u2013 has fuelled public dissent.\nOn Wednesday night, traffic on a major motorway was briefly blocked as thousands of people attended a protest in Tel Aviv organised by women\u2019s advocacy groups to demand an immediate government proposal for a new deal to free the hostages.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Qatar accuses Netanyahu of deliberately obstructing Gaza mediation efforts", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/25/qatar-accuses-benjamin-netanyahu-deliberately-obstructing-gaza-mediation-efforts"}
