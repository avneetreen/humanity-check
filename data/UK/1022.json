He described conditions inside the hospital as \u201ctragic\u201d.\nIsrael is still conducting search operations inside Gaza\u2019s largest hospital having sent troops inside on Wednesday. Israel claims Hamas is operating a command centre in tunnels beneath the health facility, allegations which have been denied by doctors and the Gaza health ministry.\n\u201cThe conditions are tragic and those in the hospital are screaming from thirst,\u201d Mr Abu Salmiya told the BBC.\n\u201cSniping operations continue, no one can move from one building to another, and we have lost communication with our colleagues,\u201d said Mr Abu Salmiya.\nIsrael\u2019s military earlier said the body of one of the hostages, kidnapped by Hamas after the group\u2019s 7 October attacks, was found in a building near the hospital.\nLate on Thursday the IDF released videos and photographs of what it described as an \u201coperational tunnel\u201d within the Al Shifa Hospital complex, as well as footage of a vehicle containing weapons. Earlier it released videos of duffel bags with guns that it said were found inside the hospital.\nHamas said the earlier video was staged, while other Palestinians said that \u2013 even if they were real \u2013 they show nothing like the militant command centre claimed by Israel to justify raiding the hospital.\n\u201cThese are weak pretexts. There is nothing for the resistance inside medical institutions,\u201d said Dr Nahed Abu Taaema, the director of the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, who said medics were alarmed for their colleagues at Al Shifa after losing contact with them since Wednesday.\nThe health ministry in Gaza said Israeli bulldozers damaged portions of the southern entrance to the medical complex.\nAshraf al-Qudra, a spokesperson for Gaza\u2019s health ministry, said \u201cthousands of women, children, sick and wounded are in danger of death\u201d as Israeli military raids on the hospital have continued.\nThe World Health Organisation has joined other humanitarian organisations, including Doctors Without Borders, to demand an end to assaults on healthcare facilities in Gaza and have called for an immediate ceasefire.\nThis comes as Israeli airstrikes continued throughout Gaza on Thursday, and the enclave experienced a widespread communications blackout due to the depletion of fuel for the generators of the primary telecommunications provider.\n\u201cAll telecom services\u201d in the Gaza strip were out of service, according to statements from the two major Palestinian mobile networks Jawwal and Paltel on Thursday, \u201cas all energy sources sustaining the network have been depleted, and fuel was not allowed in\u201d.\nOn Thursday, Israeli forces said they found the body of 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss, who was abducted from Be\u2019eri kibbutz near the Gaza border by Hamas on 7 October.\nWeiss\u2019s body was found in a building near the al-Shifa hospital, said officials of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). She had been receiving cancer treatment, according to Israeli forces.\n\u201cThe body of Yehudit Weiss, who was abducted by the Hamas terrorist organisation, was extracted by IDF troops from a structure adjacent to the Shifa hospital in the Gaza Strip and was transferred to Israeli territory,\u201d said a spokesperson.\n\u201cIn the structure in which Yehudit was located, military equipment including Kalashnikov rifles and RPGs were also found,\u201d said the spokesperson.\nWeiss\u2019s husband, Shmulik, was reportedly among the estimated 1,200 Israelis killed during the 7 October Hamas terror attack across southern Israel.\nAccording to the Bring Them Home Now group, Weiss was without her medication when she was taken hostage by Hamas.\n\u201cUnfortunately, Yehudit was murdered by terrorists in Gaza and we did not get to her in time,\u201d the IDF spokesperson told the media.\nSince 7 October, at least 11,470 Palestinians have been killed in retaliatory strikes by Israel on Gaza. Reports said this figure has not been updated for a few days due to the collapse of the Gaza Strip\u2019s health system amid Israel\u2019s constant bombardment.\nMeanwhile, it was reported that Israel has dropped leaflets in southern Gaza, advising Palestinian civilians to evacuate four towns situated on the eastern periphery of Khan Younis city in southern Gaza.\nIsrael had initially told civilians to flee northern Gaza, and tens of thousands of Palestinians had migrated to UN-run shelters and family homes in recent weeks.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Al-Shifa Hospital: Patients at Gaza\u2019s largest hospital \u2018screaming from thirst\u2019 as water and oxygen run out", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/al-shifa-hospital-patients-screaming-from-thirst-gaza-b2448924.html"}
