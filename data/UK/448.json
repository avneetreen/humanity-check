Security Council meeting Tuesday on Pyongyang\u2019s latest intercontinental ballistic missile launch, which it called \u201ca warning counter-measure\u201d to threats from the U.S. and other hostile forces.\nNorth Korean Ambassador Kim Song said this is \u201cthe most dangerous year\u201d in the military-security landscape on the Korean Peninsula, pointing to stepped up U.S.-South Korean military exercises and the U.S. deployment of nuclear-powered submarines and other nuclear assets to the area that have raised a \u201cnuclear war danger.\u201d\nThe U.S. and nine allies pointed to five North Korean ICBM launches, over 25 ballistic missiles launches and three satellite launches using ballistic missile technology this year, violating multiple Security Council resolutions and threatening \u201cthe peace and stability of its neighbors and the international community.\u201d\nIn a statement read just before the council meeting by U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood, surrounded by diplomats from the other countries, the 10 countries condemned the latest ICBM launch on Dec. 17 and all launches before it.\nNorth Korea\u2019s Song urged the international community to think about North Korea\u2019s security concerns, calling its counter-measures an \u201cabsolutely reasonable, normal and reflective response\u201d in exercise of its legitimate right to self-defense.\nHe warned the U.S. and South Korea that if they continue \u201cwith their reckless and irresponsible military threat,\u201d North Korea\u2019s armed forces \u201cwill never remain an onlooker to it and the provokers will be held entirely responsible for all the consequences.\u201d\nNorth Korea will also \u201ccontinue to build up its strategic power of a more advanced type to contain and control any threat from the U.S. and its followers with immediate, overwhelming and decisive counter-measures,\u201d Song warned.\nThe Security Council imposed sanctions after North Korea\u2019s first nuclear test explosion in 2006 and tightened them over the years in a total of 10 resolutions seeking \u2014 so far unsuccessfully \u2014 to cut funds and curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\nThe last sanctions resolution was adopted by the council in December 2017. China and Russia vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution in May 2022 that would have imposed new sanctions over a spate of intercontinental ballistic missile launches. And the two veto-wielding council members have blocked any council action, including media statements, since then.\nThe 10 countries \u2014 Albania, Ecuador, France, Japan, Malta, South Korea, Slovenia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States \u2014 said silence from the Security Council \u201csends the wrong message to Pyongyang and all proliferators.\u201d\nThey urged North Korea to abandon its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs, \u201cand instead invest in feeding the people in North Korea\u201d and engage in diplomacy. They also urged all Security Council members to overcome their prolonged silence and uphold the nuclear nonproliferation regime.\nRussia\u2019s deputy U.N. ambassador Anna Evstigneeva called attempts to condemn Pyongyang \u201ca one-sided approach.\u201d\nShe warned that the situation is escalating \u201cto a dangerous brink,\u201d pointing to both Pyongyang and Seoul justifying their hostile moves as self-defense. And she accused the United States of deploying its massive military machine in the region, saying this looks \u201cmore and more like preparations for an offensive operation,\u201d even though the U.S. says it has no hostile intentions.\nEvstigneeva said Russia again calls for a peaceful settlement of all issues on the Korean Peninsula through political and diplomatic means \u201cwithout external pressure.\u201d\nWood, the U.S. deputy ambassador, countered that U.S. military exercises are defensive and it\u2019s North Korea that has violated U.N. sanctions \u2014 not South Korea, Japan or the U.S. And he said the United States has tried repeatedly to have an unconditional dialogue with Pyongyang but it has refused.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "North Korea and Russia clash with US, South Korea and allies over Pyongyang's latest missile launch", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-north-korea-south-korea-pyongyang-russia-b2466971.html"}
