Each barracks will house 250 Guard troopers, who are recruited from or trained by the army.\nThat would mean between 9,500 and 10,000 Guard troops would be stationed permanently in the resort, about the same number sent there following the hurricane, which caused at least 48 deaths.\nIn the days following the storm's Oct. 25 landfall, Guard troops proved incapable of stopping days of ransacking that stripped every large- and medium-sized store in Acapulco to the walls.\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has promised a barracks in every neighborhood of the resort, which has also been hit by nearly 20 years of drug cartel violence. The president has given the armed forces almost exclusive control of the fight against the cartels and has proposed placing the National Guard under army command.\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has refused to consider government loans or grants to the hotels, most of which had windows or walls blown out. Many were reduced to their skeletal concrete or steel frames.\nInstead, he said the government would pay half the interest on reconstruction loans from private banks. But with no cash flow, many hotel owners doubt they can qualify for big private bank loans.\nL\u00f3pez Obrador has also refused to earmark specific funds in the 2024 budget for reconstruction efforts, a move that has led to demonstrations by a protest caravan of Acapulco residents who drove to Mexico City this week.\nEvodio Vel\u00e1zquez, an opposition party member and former mayor of Acapulco, said the demonstrators were demanding a rebuilding program roughly four times the size of the $3.4 billion plan the president announced last week.\n\u201cWe want dignified treatment for Acapulco in the federal budget,\u201d Vel\u00e1zquez said Monday.\nThe protesters camped out Tuesday in tents outside Mexico City's National Palace, where L\u00f3pez Obrador lives and works.\nMuch of the $3.4 billion aid program will go to making payments of $2,000-$3,000 per damaged home, setting up temporary job programs and providing free electricity for residents for several months. The government is also handing out 250,000 appliances like refrigerators and fans and providing weekly food packages for each family.\nSome stores in Acapulco began tentatively re-opening this week, but they reportedly stocked only basic goods and let in only 20 customers at a time.\nThe federal civil defense agency tallied 220,000 homes that were damaged by the hurricane, which ripped the tin roofs off thousands of homes.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Mexico's hurricane reconstruction plans prioritize military barracks, owners left to rebuild hotels", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/acapulco-ap-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-mexico-mexico-city-b2443356.html"}
