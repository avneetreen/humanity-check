In one of the more recent incidents, a Chinese pilot flew within 10 feet (3 meters) of a U.S. Air Force B-52, which was conducting routine operations over the South China Sea in international airspace.\nWhile officials touted the Brown-Liu call as an important initial move, the Pentagon has continued to express concerns about China\u00b4s aggressive military interactions in the Indo-Pacific and has worked to build alliances with other nations in the region.\nEarlier this month, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with defense chiefs from Australia and the United Kingdom to forge a new agreement to increase technology cooperation and information sharing, as part of a broader effort to counter China's rapidly growing influence in the Indo-Pacific.\nThe two superpowers have reopened channels after President Joe Biden and Xi Jinping held talks in San Francisco last month. Xi reportedly gave Biden a blunt warning that China would soon 'reunify' with Taiwan , but insisted he would prefer to do it 'peacefully' and not by force\nChinese and Philippine naval and coast guard ships have confronted each other repeatedly around the shoal in the Spratly Islands in recent months\nThe new technology agreement is the next step in widening military cooperation with Australia that includes plans to help equip Sydney with a fleet of eight nuclear-powered submarines.\nAnd the defense leaders pointed to efforts by China to restrict freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific as a reason to bolster their cooperation.\nAlso, earlier this week, Admiral John Aquilino, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, expressed concerns about the increased joint military actions by China and Russia in the region.\nSpeaking in Tokyo, he said it is far beyond a 'marriage of convenience' between Beijing and Moscow, and he urged China to stop escalating maritime confrontations with its neighbors.\nChina\u00b4s defense ministry, meanwhile, has criticized the U.S. for interfering in both Taiwan and the South China Sea, charging that American arms sales to Taiwan are making the situation more dangerous.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "U.S. and China's top generals speak for the first time in 16 MONTHS: Senior military officers hold video call to ease tensions after Xi 'warned Biden he wanted to take back Taiwan SOON'", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12889993/U-S-Chinas-generals-speak-time-16-MONTHS-Senior-military-officers-hold-video-call-ease-tensions-Xi-warned-Biden-wanted-Taiwan-SOON.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"}
