Only four prisoners have been released so far.\nA three-year-old American orphan is believed to be among the hostages held by Hamas after his parents were slaughtered, the White House has revealed.

Medical staff say patients could die if they are moved and Palestinian officials say Israeli fire makes it dangerous for others to leave.\nIsrael's Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter broke ranks as he called the evacuations 'Gaza's Nakba' - a reference to the mass dispossessions of Palestinians after Israel was founded in 1948.\n'Operationally there's no way to conduct a war the way the IDF wants to conduct it inside Gaza territories,' Dichter said. 'I don't know how it will end'.\nThe comments drew an immediate slap down from Netanyahu - who is sliding dismally in the polls. The PM said: 'Every word has meaning when it comes to diplomacy. If you don\u2019t know - don't speak.'\nMeanwhile, a Hamas leader who was presumed dead is alive, Israeli spies are said to believe.\nMohammed Sinwar was pronounced dead in 2014 by Hamas which released an image of him lying on a bloodstained bed.\nBut in reality this was a stunt aimed at protecting him from Israeli assassination attempts and he was one of three to four figures behind the October 7 attack.\n'He was 100 per cent one of the core team who planned Oct 7,' a former Mossad counter-terror chief told the Telegraph.\n'In the military leadership he's very important,' the source said.\nMohammed Sinwar was pronounced dead in 2014 by Hamas, which released an image of him lying on a bloodstained bed\nSources claim this was a stunt aimed at protecting Mohammed (pictured) from Israeli assassination attempts\nMohammed Sinwar is the younger brother of Yahya Sinwa, Hamas's leader in Gaza and Israel 's most-wanted terrorist\n'He's around number seven on the wanted list, alongside the likes of Mohammed Deif, Marwan Issa and Tawfiq Abu Naim. He's an important figure and he's still alive for sure.'\nMohammed Sinwar is the younger brother of Yahya Sinwa, Hamas's leader in Gaza and Israel's most-wanted terrorist.\nHe helped free his elder brother from an Israeli jail during a 2011 prisoner exchange and is considered an 'expert' in using kidnappings to secure the release of prisoners, according to Ronen Solomon - an intelligence analyst and author of the Intelli Times blog.\nAs the war continues to tear Israel and Palestine apart, Biden ordered airstrikes against two facilities in Syria used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards on Sunday.\nCarried out by Air Force F-15E fighter jets, the strikes are the latest retaliatory attacks for the daily barrage of rocket hits on US forces in Iraq and Syria.\nThe US jets hit structures in Abu Kamal and a safe house in Mayadin - used for weapons and ammunition storage and command and control HQs.\nThe US jets hit structures in Abu Kamal and a safe house in Mayadin - used for weapons and ammunition storage and command and control HQs\nOn Sunday, five US Army special forces troops were also killed in a helicopter crash in the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe MH-60 Black Hawk helicopter was on a refueling training mission when it crashed off the coast of Cyprus late Friday, officials told The New York Times.\nAn investigation has been launched but there is no indication of hostile activity.\nThe Pentagon has dispatched commando teams - including Delta Force and SEAL Team 6 - to the region to stand-by for hostage rescues in the Gaza Strip.
