Hamas\u00b4military arm said its fighters shelled Israeli troops in Jabaliya and Jabaliya refugee camp.\nIsrael faces international criticism for the civilian death toll but it blames Hamas, citing the militants\u00b4 use of crowded residential areas and tunnels. Israel has launched thousands of airstrikes since Oct. 7. It says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, without presenting evidence.\nIsrael also faces allegations of mistreating Palestinian men and teenage boys detained in homes, shelters, hospitals and elsewhere during the offensive.
