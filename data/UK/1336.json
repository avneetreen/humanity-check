Brian Mast (R-Fla.) spoke Wednesday on the House floor about his bill, the Hamas International Financing Prevention Act, which would impose sanctions with respect to foreign support for militant groups like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\nAdvertisement\nThe bill\u2019s original text included a provision that exempted humanitarian aid to Gaza civilians from broader restrictions, but Mast himself removed the exemption\u2019s language and replaced it with a provision that would require President Joe Biden to issue a case-by-case waiver to approve humanitarian aid.\n\u201cI think when we look at this, as a whole, I would encourage the other side to not so lightly throw around the idea of innocent Palestinian civilians, as is frequently said,\u201d Mast said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we would so lightly throw around the term \u2018innocent Nazi civilians\u2019 during World War II.\u201d\nMast: I think when we look at this, as a whole, I would encourage the other side to not so lightly throw around the idea of innocent Palestinian civilians.

Recently, a humanitarian corridor has opened up, but very few trucks have come in with aid.\nDespite the White House and much of Congress providing unwavering support for Israel in its attacks, Mast\u2019s dehumanizing rhetoric still drew swift backlash from Democrats and civil rights organizations.\n\u201cRacist and bigoted comments like this are why 6-year-old Palestinian-American Wadea Al Fayoume was murdered by being stabbed 26 times. Disgusting and disgraceful,\u201d Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) tweeted, referring to the killing in Plainfield, Illinois, that\u2019s being investigated as a hate crime.\nIfNotNow, a Jewish American organization focused on ending U.S. support for Israeli apartheid, tweeted that Mast\u2019s comments are \u201cdangerous, wrong and a craven attempt to justify more bombings & more killings.\u201d\n\u201cEvery member of Congress should be condemning this vile rhetoric & taking action,\u201d the group said. \u201cDemanding a ceasefire has never been more urgent.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nEarlier this month, Mast arrived at a GOP conference meeting dressed in an Israeli Defense Forces uniform. Asked why the lawmaker was wearing the uniform of another country\u2019s military, Mast said it was in response to Palestinian American Rep.
