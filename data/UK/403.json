The top advisers assessed the country\u2019s scheme, before eventually deciding that US intelligence didn\u2019t match that of Israel.\nUS intelligence apparently didn\u2019t indicate that Hezbollah \u2013 which is designated a terrorist organisation by the US \u2013 planned to attack.\nThe president then phoned Mr Netanyahu \u2014 with the call spaning 45 minutes, according to the Journal. The two leaders didn\u2019t see eye-to-eye on the issue: Mr Biden reportedly said that de-escalation was key to avoiding a broader war, while Mr Netanyahu and members of his war cabinet insisted that the expanding conflict was unavoidable.\nAfter roughly six hours exchanging calls, Israeli officials abandoned the original plan.\nUS President Joe Biden meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on 18 October (via REUTERS)\nIn the meantime, Israeli soldiers along the Israel-Lebanon border received orders to prepare to combat Hezbollah fighters crossing the border. Those along northern Israel were urged to head into bomb shelters for safety.\nBut \u2013 thanks to Mr Biden\u2019s intervention \u2013 the fighting never transpired.\nThe Biden administration\u2019s efforts to prevent fighting between Hezbollah and Israeli forces on 11 October appears to be part of a larger strategy.\nThe New York Times reported on Friday 22 December that senior White House Adviser Amos Hochstein has been holding discussions liaising with Israel, Lebanon and Hezbollah to try to minimise tensions along the border and prevent further escalation.\nStill, fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border has resulted in the deaths of nine Israeli soldiers, four Israeli civilians and over 100 Lebanese people, most of whom were Hezbollah militants, PBS reported.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Biden convinced Netanyahu not to strike Hezbollah after Hamas attacks, says report", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-netanyahu-hezbollah-hamas-israel-b2468939.html"}
