While details are sparse, the accepted boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space is 62 miles above the surface, known as the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line\nCorrection: An earlier version of this caption stated the image was of the Arrow shooting down the rocket. In fact, it is footage showing Israeli airspace intercepting another rocket using an F-35i - taken the same day as Arrow blasted the rocket outside of Earth's atmosphere\nArrow provides hypersonic capabilities and can defend a vast area, providing a comprehensive defense of strategic sites and large populated areas.\nREAD MORE:Netanyahu warns 'no one will be safe' if the Middle East falls to Iran's 'axis of terror' and insists Israel is engaged in a 'global battle' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called on the world to back his fight against Hamas, claiming that Israel is engaged in a 'global battle' against an Iran-led 'axis of terror.'
