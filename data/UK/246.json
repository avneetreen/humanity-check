Some scuffled with Palestinian security forces in riot gear.\nAnalysts and others in Ramallah said Palestinian expectations of the visit were \u201clower than low\u201d.\n\u201cThe only purpose is to give the Israelis time to finish off Gaza,\u201d Atef al-Hamoud, a local government functionary, said.\nJamal Zakout, an analyst, said: \u201cThis war has damaged the image of the US in all Arab countries, not just Palestine. No one can ignore their unfair diplomacy. For three months all the US has done is protect Israel.\u201d\nView image in fullscreen Demonstrators protest against Blinken\u2019s visit in Ramallah. Photograph: Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images\nOn Tuesday, Blinken met top Israeli officials and repeated calls for greater protection of civilians, more aid to be allowed into Gaza and for residents to be allowed to return home where possible.\nHinting at having held difficult talks with Israeli officials on Tuesday, Blinken said the US had a duty to be as forthright as possible with friends and called for Israel to make \u201chard decisions\u201d.\nThe US has offered staunch support to Israel since the outbreak of its war with Hamas three months ago, but the refusal of Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, to offer detailed public plans for the governance of Gaza when Israel\u2019s military offensive ends has angered Washington.\nIsrael has so far ruled out calls to allow the internationally recognised PA to govern Gaza and the occupied West Bank after the conflict\u2019s end \u2013 Washington\u2019s preferred option \u2013 and instead suggested some form of governance involving local power-brokers or clans, with the Israel Defense Forces playing a significant supervisory role.\nNetanyahu, whose hold on power depends on far-right support, has also ignored US pressure to rein in ministers who have called for the mass voluntary emigration of Palestinians from Gaza. Washington has said such rhetoric is \u201cinflammatory and unacceptable\u201d.\nDespite Blinken\u2019s complaint that the \u201cdaily toll on civilians in Gaza \u2026 is far too high\u201d, heavy fighting continued in Gaza with clashes in the centre and south.\nAt least 23,570 people, mostly women and children, have been killed during Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, according to its health ministry. Swaths of the territory have been devastated, with most of its 2.3 million population displaced and facing an acute humanitarian crisis. Local officials said at least 147 people had died over the previous 24 hours.\nIsraeli military losses have reached 186 since the beginning of the offensive in Gaza, which came after Hamas militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their homes and at a music festival on 7 October.\nHamas also took about 250 hostages. Israel has said 132 of them remain captive, though at least 25 of these are thought to have been killed.\nOn Tuesday, Blinken voiced hopes that, after the war, Israel could push on with its efforts towards regional integration, following its US-brokered normalisation deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and other states.\nThe top US diplomat, on his fourth tour of the Middle East since the outbreak of the war, also dismissed a case filed by South Africa against Israel at the international court of justice accusing it of genocide, saying the allegation was \u201cmeritless\u201d and \u201cparticularly galling\u201d as Hamas had called for Israel\u2019s annihilation.\nZakout said that any political scenario for after the war needed unity among Palestinian factions.\n\u201cIt will be impossible to implement any deal if Hamas is not included. We need to break not just the [conflict] but this Palestinian polarisation too,\u201d he said.\nThe PA \u2013 established in the 1990s as part of the then peace process to run areas in the West Bank and Gaza under Palestinian control \u2013 has said it is willing to play a role in Gaza, from where it was expelled by Hamas in 2006, but only if it is part of a clear, comprehensive peace plan with Israel that also includes the West Bank.\nThe political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, said last week he was \u201copen to the idea\u201d of a single Palestinian administration in Gaza and the West Bank.\nThe popularity of Hamas in the West Bank has risen sharply in recent months, despite the devastation caused by the conflict.\nRecent polling from the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research found 85% of West Bank respondents voiced satisfaction with the role of Hamas in the war.\nSupport for Hamas among the Palestinian public has typically spiked during conflicts, pollsters said. The group appears to have also earned significant goodwill for securing the release of 240 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails in return for 100 hostages, mostly Israeli, during the week-long ceasefire in Gaza at the end of November.\n\u201cYou now see women, progressive feminists in Ramallah, marching for Hamas, not because they love them or adhere to their ideology or want their ideology to prevail but because they see someone saying: \u2018I will fight back\u2019 and that is inspiring,\u201d said Nour Odeh, a Ramallah-based commentator.\nSpeaking in his family\u2019s grocer\u2019s store in the Qalandiya camp on the outskirts of Ramallah, 20-year-old Salam Awad said Hamas had \u201cdestroyed the pride and morale of Israel\u201d.\n\u201cOnly Hamas can do this, not this useless degenerate,\u201d Awad said, referring to Abbas.\nBlinken will now travel from the West Bank to the Gulf state of Bahrain, home base of the US Fifth Fleet, for talks with King Hamad on preventing a regional escalation of the war, the state department said.\nAbbas will travel to the Red Sea port city of Aqaba to discuss a \u201cpush for an immediate ceasefire\u201d in Gaza in talks with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II and the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.\nThe US has consistently rejected calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, though Blinken has called for \u201cmore food, more water, more medicine\u201d to reach those in need in the territory.\nIsraeli military officials said Israel was \u201cready and willing to facilitate as much humanitarian aid as the world will give\u201d and that the highest number of trucks had entered Gaza since the war began. Aid agencies say the quantity remained inadequate given the acute humanitarian suffering caused by the conflict.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Blinken restates commitment to Palestinian state on West Bank visit", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/10/blinken-restates-commitment-to-palestinian-state-on-west-bank-visit"}
