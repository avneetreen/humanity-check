Such a step would mark a major escalation, almost certainly proving extremely deadly for civilians in both Lebanon and Israel. It could also force a confrontation with Iran, a regional heavyweight that backs the powerful Lebanese militia Hezbollah.\nAdvertisement\nOfficials were briefed on the Lebanon concerns before a Tuesday afternoon meeting of top policymakers from across the national security establishment, one official said. HuffPost interviewed multiple US and foreign officials who were not authorised to speak on the record.\n\u201cThis last week, the level of concern in D.C. about a potential war on the Israel-Lebanon front has gone up three or four notches,\u201d said Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank.\nIsrael\u2019s possible actions in Lebanon would be just the latest kindling for a major Mideast conflagration, following a string of attacks tied to Iran against US troops in the region\nOn Sunday, a US Navy warship and commercial vessels in a crucial global waterway near Yemen faced drone and missile strikes from an Iran-linked Yemeni armed group known as the Houthis that sparked an hours-long firefight, and on Wednesday an American destroyer shot down a Houthi drone. The Houthis have publicly said Israel\u2019s moves in Gaza are motivating their assault, and the US is now considering options for a show of force against the Houthis, officials say. The Pentagon has documented dozens of attacks against American forces throughout the Middle East, including in Iraq and Syria, in recent weeks. The Syria and Iraq incidents were discussed at the Tuesday meeting, according to a US official.\nAdvertisement\nAnd the source of much of the tension across the region \u2015 the extremely high toll of Israel\u2019s Gaza operation, which has killed two civilians for every militant, for a total death toll of more than 16,000 so far \u2015 is far from abating. Despite repeated calls for Israeli restraint from senior figures in the Biden administration, US intelligence assesses the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are committed to \u201cbusiness as usual,\u201d with only limited concern about civilian casualties, a U.S. official said, and there are suspicions the renewed campaign is actually bloodier than the previous offensive in northern Gaza.\n\u201cHumanitarian organizations are ringing the alarm bell more than they ever have during the conflict\u201d in talking to the State Department, an official in the department said. Those aid groups are telling diplomats they may need to wind down their operations in Gaza given the heavy fighting, which would make the situation \u201cdramatically worse,\u201d the official said, on top of shortages of food and a rampant spread of disease among the 1.9 million Gazans forced out of their homes since Israel began its offensive in retaliation for an Oct. 7 attack by the Gaza-based group Hamas.\nResidents and civil defense teams conduct a search-and-rescue operation Wednesday amid the rubble of a building that collapsed following an Israeli attack on houses belonging to the Abu Hubeyze and Abu Ayesha families at the Nuseirat refugee camp in Deir al-Balah, Gaza.

A White House official told HuffPost the Tuesday meeting of top officials did not include discussion of the Lebanon concerns.\nAnother State Department official told HuffPost: \u201cThis is a pivotal moment in history, and we should feel angry about how [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu has literally put our reputation on fire to advance his personal political agenda. The collateral effects to American security are extremely consequential.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nNetanyahu\u2019s security failures are widely blamed for the assault on Israel, and he is expected to resign at the end of the war. He is also facing criminal charges that could land him in jail.\nA third State Department official voiced frustration with recent news articles suggesting the US is encouraging Israeli caution and similar public statements, arguing: \u201cIt just feels like patting ourselves on the back while it increasingly seems like the IDF are waging a campaign of ethnic cleansing.\u201d\nNetanyahu and some of his lieutenants, notably Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, have repeatedly suggested combating Hezbollah in Lebanon as part of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas attack and hostage-taking. Analysts believe the Israeli government could count on that move to distract from their controversial Gaza operation, which has seemingly had little major success in weakening Israel\u2019s enemies.\n\u201cThere is a will on the Israeli side to take advantage of the current rise in tensions to change the realities on the ground\u2026 to push Hezbollah far from the Israeli border,\u201d a European diplomat told HuffPost, pointing to Israel\u2019s evacuation of tens of thousands of citizens away from communities near Lebanon.\nThe diplomat sees comments by Israeli officials and some of their supporters as encouraging a wider blow-up that could have huge consequences.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThere is a concerning return of the clash-of-civilizations rhetoric, which tends to dehumanize the peoples of the region\u201d and create the impression of \u201ca values-based war,\u201d the diplomat said. They noted Israeli President Isaac Herzog\u2019s recent statement that the war on the Palestinian territory of Gaza is meant \u201cto save Western civilization.\u201d\nSuch comments shift focus away from fundamental reasons for bloodshed, like the decades-long international failure to craft an Israeli-Palestinian deal that addresses Palestinian aspirations, they continued, fuelling cycles of violence.\n\u201cThe fact that the Americans and Europeans just \u2026 gave up, in a way, means we\u2019re giving an opening for actors like Iran to embrace the cause and turn it into\u201d a rallying cry, the diplomat said. \u201cIn the Middle East, there is a constant failure of US policy: It\u2019s been relying almost exclusively on military interventionism, and there has been no accountability for many of these failed policies \u2015 the 2003 Iraq War being maybe the biggest blunder among all of this \u2015 so now you\u2019re seeing a multiplication of non-state actors fighting a Western military presence, which just leads to more military options being put on the table.\u201d\nHighest Lebanon Fears Since 2006\nAnxiety around Lebanon, which is home to 5.5 million people and is already experiencing a major economic crisis, is dominating conversations among Middle East watchers.\nRanda Slim highlighted recent remarks by the Israeli defence minister and references by Israeli officials to a United Nations resolution requiring Hezbollah to leave parts of southern Lebanon, which the militia has not done.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThis is definitely Israel testing the waters, and they are seeing, \u2018How will the international community react?\u2019\u201d the analyst said. \u201cThey care about the Saudis, the Emiratis and the Americans\u2026 if these three countries mount a joint pushback against this idea, then Israel can be dissuaded from going forward. But it\u2019s very clear that there is a plan, and the groundwork is being prepared for implementation.\u201d\nIsrael and Hezbollah last fought a war in 2006. Following October 7, they have had their worst direct fighting since, with Israel conducting artillery and air strikes within Lebanon and Hezbollah targeting Israeli positions almost every day. The clashes have killed about 100 people in Lebanon, including civilians and journalists.\nWithin the Biden administration, officials this week privately connected their Lebanon fears to a lack of clarity from Israel\u2019s Ministry of Defense about what it plans to do with US weaponry, a U.S. official told HuffPost. Israel receives more than $3 billion in military aid each year, and Congress is weighing a Biden administration proposal to send the country more than $10 billion in additional military support.\nThe limited details on Israeli intentions are making it harder for the administration to negotiate that package with lawmakers, the U.S. official said. Dozens of legislators have said they are unhappy with Israel\u2019s conduct in its Gaza operation, and on Thursday, 13 senators, led by Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, introduced a bill to add more conditions on military aid flowing to foreign countries to ensure the support does not enable violations of international humanitarian law. Human rights groups have accused Israel of repeatedly committing war crimes in its Gaza campaign, including with US equipment.\n\u201cWe did ask for a breakdown of where this aid is all going, and the administration wasn\u2019t able to provide that for us,\u201d a Senate aide told HuffPost. \u201cProbably because they don\u2019t want to admit that they are essentially writing a blank check and that they don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe aide sees this week\u2019s Israeli killing of a Lebanese soldier as a warning sign. Israel expressed \u201cregret\u201d; many observers saw the incident as proof the tense situation could quickly spiral into all-out war.\n\u201cWe should be putting more pressure on the Israelis to not engage in Lebanon in unhelpful ways,\u201d the aide continued, calling the Lebanese Armed Forces \u2015 one of the few relatively respected institutions in the country \u2015 \u201cthe one force that\u2019s been somewhat helpful in minimizing the spread of this conflict\u2026 not only in keeping Hezbollah at bay but also helping to provide a measure of security in the region, for us specifically in protecting the U.S. Embassy [in Beirut] from protests when the situation could have escalated really quickly.\u201d\nThe European diplomat said the prolonged tension means there are \u201cmany occasions for blunders,\u201d saying that, for instance, regardless of whether Israel had meant to kill journalists in Lebanon, \u201ccertainly preserving journalists\u2019 lives does not seem like a high priority.\u201d On Thursday, AFP and Reuters published investigations blaming Israel for an October 13 strike that killed a Reuters reporter and hurt six other journalists.\nThough European governments want to forestall a bigger war \u2015 and have tools they can use, unlike Washington, such as diplomatic ties with Iran and sustained contact with some militant groups \u2015 \u201cultimately it\u2019s the Americans who are really calling the shots,\u201d the diplomat continued.\nA residential area in Lebanon destroyed by an Israeli airstrike last week that killed one person and wounded three others. Anadolu via Getty Images\nAdvertisement\nSlim sees the Biden administration as key to stopping a Lebanon war and yet being insufficiently assertive about that priority so far.\nHezbollah has shown it does not want a more intense fight, she said. Had it sought that outcome, it might have carried out disproportionate attacks on Israel or taken steps such as kidnapping Israelis or striking Israeli targets abroad.\n\u201cIf Israel decides they want to go for it\u2026 it\u2019s going to be costly,\u201d Slim said, describing Hezbollah as stronger now than it was in 2006 and willing to bombard major Israeli cities and infrastructure. She also predicted that Israel would pay a price globally by being seen as \u201cthe aggressor\u201d and that Hezbollah\u2019s allies would retaliate against both Israeli and US targets.\nOn Thursday, US diplomats in Jerusalem described how deeply the current Gaza war has already hurt Israel\u2019s economy, writing to the State Department in a diplomatic cable viewed by HuffPost.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if Israel can afford going forward, especially with a [US] administration that has given them unconditional support so far in their war against Hamas and made it clear to them that an expansion of the war is not something this administration wants,\u201d Slim said. \u201cFor Israel now to do this \u2026 is like stabbing [President Joe Biden] in the back.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nShe thinks the US should establish \u201ca red line\u201d to dispel Israeli expectations of American assistance regardless of Israeli policies.\n\u201cIsrael has taken for granted that if the conflict were to expand, US aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean are going to come to the rescue. The administration needs to make it clear that if Israel decides to expand this war, then they are going to be left on their own,\u201d Slim said.\nA Web Of Flashpoints\nA greater crisis could be triggered thousands of miles away from Israel\u2019s borders.\nExperts tracking Iraq, home to a number of well-armed militias and hundreds of US and allied troops focused on the Islamic State group, see an attempt by local forces to \u201cout-radical\u201d each other in their response to the Gaza conflict.\nAnd Yemen\u2019s Houthis are a wild card given that they gained serious influence only a decade ago. They are little understood by most governments and have few links with international players who often try to prevent instability.\n\u201cEveryone continues to underestimate the recklessness of the Houthis,\u201d said Farea Al-Muslimi, a research fellow at the Chatham House think tank.\nAdvertisement\nHe would not be surprised if the militia targeted regional countries that have ties to Israel, such as the United Arab Emirates \u2015 which the Houthis have struck before \u2015 or Bahrain. The Gaza war has already undercut attempts to end the Yemen civil war between the Houthis and US-backed forces, he noted, forcing the postponement of scheduled October talks in Saudi Arabia that could have replaced a shaky truce with a real peace deal.\nThe Saudis are likely best positioned to persuade the Houthis to avoid an escalation given the Yemen militia\u2019s interest in avoiding renewed Saudi bombing in their country, Al-Muslimi said, so the US could push Riyadh to firmly convey that message.\nYet the Biden administration has consistently been reluctant to use its leverage over Saudi Arabia as Biden\u2019s leading Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, has focused on deepening US ties to the kingdom and convincing it to establish relations with Israel.\nA congressional aide pointed to the US\u2019s recent approval of a nearly $600 million military surveillance aircraft deal for Saudi Arabia, which the aide said Biden granted without using it to secure anything from the Saudis in terms of addressing Palestinian frustrations or promising not to violate human rights norms with American equipment.", "source_domain": "www.huffingtonpost.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "U.S. Officials Fear Israel-Gaza Conflict Could Spark Broader War", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/us-officials-privately-raise-fears-of-israel-gaza-conflict-sparking-a-broader-war_uk_6572e750e4b001ec86a799bb"}
