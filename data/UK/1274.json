The total number of deaths now stands at 10,022, including 4,104 children. The number of casualties in Gaza has not been independently verified.\nThe deaths of scores of aid workers in airstrikes on Gaza over the past month has made the conflict the deadliest ever for UN workers. At least 88 people who worked for the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, have been killed since 7 October, and 47 of its buildings have been damaged.\nIsrael\u2019s military announced late Sunday it had encircled Gaza City and divided the besieged coastal strip into two. \u201cToday there is north Gaza and south Gaza,\u201d Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told reporters, calling it a \u201csignificant stage\u201d in Israel\u2019s war against the Hamas militant group ruling the territory.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it is carrying out airstrikes against sites belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. The IDF said on Monday it had identified about 30 launches from Lebanon towards northern Israel.\nIn its latest situational update, Israel\u2019s military claims that Israeli jets struck 450 Hamas targets, and claims to have killed Jamal Mussa, who it says \u201cwas responsible for the special security operations in the Hamas terrorist organisation\u201d. The IDF claims have not been independently verified.\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has said the protection of civilians \u201cmust be paramount\u201d in the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas, warning that the Gaza Strip was becoming \u201ca graveyard for children\u201d. Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, responded by saying: \u201cShame on you.\u201d\nThe leaders of the UN\u2019s major humanitarian agencies as well as international charities have called for an \u201cimmediate humanitarian ceasefire\u201d in Gaza, calling the situation \u201chorrific\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d in a rare joint statement. The signatories included the heads of OCHA, UNICEF, the World Food Programme, the WHO, Save the Children and CARE International.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel and Hamas at war: what we know on day 31", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/06/israel-and-hamas-at-war-what-we-know-on-day-31"}
