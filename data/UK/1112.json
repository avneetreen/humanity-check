There are concerns that North Korea might miscalculate and make a move against the South while the world is focused on the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.\n\u201cAn effective way to prevent North Korea from miscalculating is to demonstrate our robust deterrence capabilities and determination towards North Korea based on the solid (South Korea) -U.S. joint defense posture,\u201d Yoon said.\n\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s provocations will not only fail to achieve its intended goal but also result in immediate and strong retaliation from (South Korea)-U.S. alliance,\u201d he said.\nThere are concerns that Russia\u2019s protracted war on Ukraine and the raging conflict between Israel and Hamas are adding to complexities and uncertainties over the security situation on the Korean Peninsula.\nSome experts say North Korea\u2019s reported pursuit of sophisticated Russian weapons technologies in return for its supply of conventional arms for Russia's war in Ukraine could help the North modernize its nuclear-capable missiles targeting South Korea and the U.S. The experts also worry that Washington's preoccupation with Ukraine and Israel might prompt North Korea to conclude that the U.S. security posture on the Korean Peninsula has weakened and launch surprise attacks or other provocations against South Korea.\nSince taking office in May last year, Yoon, a conservative, has made a reinforced military partnership with the U.S. the center of his foreign policy in response to North Korea\u2019s evolving nuclear threats. Since his inauguration, Yoon said that North Korea has test-launched a total of 87 ballistic missiles.\nDespite this, many foreign analysts assess North Korea still doesn't possess functioning nuclear-tipped missiles. But they say that Russian support could help North Korea overcome the last remaining technological hurdles to acquire such weapons.\nBoth North Korea and Russia have dismissed as groundless the speculated weapons transfer deal, which would violate U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban any arms trade to and from North Korea.\n\u201cThese two countries\u2019 military cooperation ... not only poses a serious threat to the security of the Korean Peninsula, Northeast Asia and Europe but also undermines the universal rules-based international order,\u201d Yoon said.\nAt meetings with many world leaders during the 21-member APEC meeting, Yoon said he\u2019ll underscore such diverse security threats posed by the \u201cillegal\u201d North Korean-Russian cooperation and discuss ways to strengthen cooperation.\nOne area where North Korea is believed to be receiving Russian technological assistance is a spy satellite launch program. After two consecutive failures to put its first military spy satellite into orbit in recent months, North Korea vowed to make a third launch attempt in October. But it didn\u2019t follow through. South Korean officials suspect it that was likely because North Korea has begun receiving Russian help.\nYoon said the main objective of North Korea\u2019s spy satellite launch, which involves a rocket, is to advance its nuclear delivery vehicle. He cited U.N. bans on any satellite launches by North Korea, because the world body views them as cover for testing its long-range missile technology. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un previously said he needed a spaced-based surveillance system to better monitor South Korean and U.S. activities and enhance the attack capability of his nuclear missiles.\n\u201cIf North Korea succeeds in launching the military reconnaissance satellite, it would signify that North Korea\u2019s ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) capabilities have been taken to a higher level,\u201d Yoon said. \u201cTherefore, we will have to come up with reinforced countermeasures.\u201d\nYoon said the recent Seoul visits by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin serve as an opportunity to demonstrate the strength of the South Korea-U.S. alliance. Observers say such back-to-back visits by top U.S. officials suggest the U.S. security commitment remains strong despite the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.\nBlinken told reporters in Seoul last week that he and his South Korean counterpart, Park Jin, discussed unspecified further actions the two countries can take with others to put more pressures on Russia not to transfer military technology to North Korea. Austin said Monday that the U.S. deterrence commitment to South Korea remains ironclad and includes a full range of America\u2019s nuclear, conventional and missile defense capabilities.\n\u201cBy building upon the ironclad (South Korea)-U.S. alliance, the Korean government is acquiring overwhelming response capabilities and a retaliation posture to establish a strong security stance,\u201d Yoon said.\nYoon said that current global challenges -- arising from the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas conflict, the climate crisis and high inflation \u2013 offer an opportunity for APEC to demonstrate its leadership again by spearheading efforts to overcome crises and to spur innovation through regional cooperation.\n\u201cI will urge the member economies to work together in the spirit of stronger solidarity and cooperation to advance trade and investment liberalization, innovation and digitalization as well as inclusive and sustainable growth,\u201d he said.\nYoon said the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have left energy security vulnerable. He said the global economy is becoming further fragmented by the weaponization of economic resources, and that supply chain risks pose the biggest obstacle to regional economic development.\n\u201cThe Asia-Pacific region must endeavor to become a free space where people, money and data as well as goods and services flow without disruption,\u201d Yoon said.\nHe also stressed the need to establish new norms for digital ethics that match the era of hyper digitalization.\n\u201cSince digital technology knows no borders and has connectivity and immediacy, it is necessary to establish universal norms that can be applied to everyone in the international community,\u201d he said.\n___\nFollow AP's Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "South Korea's Yoon will warn APEC leaders about the risks of a Russia-North Korea arms deal", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/north-korea-ap-south-korea-apec-russia-b2446735.html"}
