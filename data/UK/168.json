But it is one of several measures that progressives have proposed to raise concerns over Israel\u2019s attacks on Gaza, where the death toll surpassed than 24,000.

The former president won 51% of the vote in Iowa, a 30-point lead over Ron DeSantis , the Florida governor. Nikki Haley , a former South Carolina governor and UN ambassador, trailed in third place with 19%.\nTrump\u2019s victory in the Iowa caucuses was heralded as an early beginning to the battle for the White House itself. Using an acronym for Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cMake America great again\u201d, Joe Biden told followers: \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: this election was always going to be you and me versus extreme Maga Republicans. It was true yesterday and it\u2019ll be true tomorrow.\u201d\nNikki Haley has said she will not appear on the debate stage without Donald Trump or Joe Biden. Ron DeSantis has confirmed he will be attending this week\u2019s GOP presidential debates in New Hampshire. Trump has not participated in any of the Republican primary debates so far.\nE Jean Carroll and Donald Trump faced each other in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday in her defamation trial against the ex-president . The trial started with jury selection. Before selection started, Trump\u2019s lead lawyer on this case, Alina Habba, told the judge that his team intends to call him as a witness.\nThe former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson , a stalwart conservative willing to sharply criticize Donald Trump, has suspended his beleaguered bid for the White House the day after he came in sixth place in Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses.\nDonald Trump is leading Joe Biden by eight percentage points among registered voters in Georgia, according to a new poll. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll also showed nearly 20% of voters weren\u2019t ready to support either candidate.\nThe Senate will vote on a resolution that would freeze military aid to Israel unless the Biden administration looks into potential human rights abuses in Gaza. The measure, forced to the floor by Senator Bernie Sanders , has little chance of passing given the overwhelming support for security assistance to Israel in Congress. The chamber is expected to debate and vote tonight.\nThe US supreme court has decided it will not hear a case centering on the debate over bathrooms for transgender students. The decision came on Tuesday despite an appeal from Indiana\u2019s metropolitan school district of Martinsville. \u2013 Guardian staff\nUpdated at 00.29 CET\n16 Jan 2024 23.35 CET Speaking on the Senate floor earlier, Republican senator Lindsay Graham said that Hamas has \u201cmilitarized\u201d schools and hospitals by operating amongst them. Israel has blamed Hamas for using hospitals for military purposes, but has not provided definitive proof backing its claims that Hamas kept a \u201ccommand center\u201d under Gaza\u2019s main al-Shifa hospital, which the Israeli Defense Forces raided in November. Two-thirds of Gaza\u2019s hospitals have been closed amidst what Joe Biden has characterized as \u201cindiscriminate bombings\u201d, during a time of acute need.\nUpdated at 23.54 CET\n16 Jan 2024 23.24 CET Sanders himself has faced criticism for declining to endorse calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, as some of his progressive colleagues have done. Amid anti-war protests across the US, progressive representatives including Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Barbara Lee and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have called for a ceasefire. In a letter to Biden, many of these lawmakers stressed that thousands of children had been killed in Israeli bombings.\nUpdated at 23.39 CET\n16 Jan 2024 23.18 CET The measure that Bernie Sanders proposed uses a mechanism in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which allows Congress to provide oversight of US military assistance, which must be used in accordance with international human rights agreements. The Senate will be voting on whether to ask the US state department to create a report on whether Israel has violated human rights accords using US military aid and equipment during its campaign in Gaza. If the measure passes, the state department will have to provide a report within 30 days \u2013 and aid to Israel would be cut off if human rights violations are found. Both Democrats and Republicans in congress oppose any conditions on aid to Israel, and Joe Biden has staunchly stood by Israel throughout its campaign against Gaza, so the proposal is very unlikely to be implemented. By forcing senators to vote on the record about whether they are willing to condition aid to Israel, however, Sanders and others lawmakers hope to spark debate on the matter. Progressives and Democrats have increasingly pushed to place conditions on aid to Israel, which has drawn international criticism for its offensive in Gaza. \u201cWhile it is clear that Israel has the right to go to war against Hamas. It does not have the right to go to war against the Palestinian people and innocent men, women and children in Gaza,\u201d Sanders said, speaking on Senate floor last week.\nUpdated at 23.39 CET\n16 Jan 2024 22.35 CET Senate to debate of Sanders' measure on Israel military aid Debate is about to begin on a measure that would condition military aid to Israel on whether the Israeli war effort in Gaza is violating human rights and international accords.

During a rally earlier this month, Trump called on Joe Biden to \u201crelease the J6 hostages\u201d, referring to the people imprisoned for their role in the January 6 insurrection. Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cgrotesque and offensive\u201d, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday. It is offensive to compare those convicted of assaulting cops and attempting to overthrow the American government \u2026 to innocent Americans, Israelis and people of other nationalities who were abducted by Hamas on October 7.\n16 Jan 2024 21.47 CET Nikki Haley has downplayed Ron DeSantis\u2019 trip down to South Carolina a day after his second-place finish in Iowa\u2019s caucuses. Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, was speaking to CNN from New Hampshire: It really doesn\u2019t matter to me why he went there. I\u2019m sure he had a great time. South Carolina is a great state. She noted that DeSantis now faced an uphill climb in both South Carolina and New Hampshire after focusing so heavily on Iowa, AP reported. She added: He\u2019s been invisible in both states. He is not my concern.
