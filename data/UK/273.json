The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sunday again insisted the war would not end until the objectives of eliminating Hamas, getting Israel\u2019s hostages returned and ensuring that Gaza won\u2019t be a threat to Israel are met. \u201cI say this to both our enemies and our friend,\u201d he told his cabinet. \u201cThis is our responsibility and this is the obligation of all of us.\u201d\nUpdated at 13.53 CET\n7 Jan 2024 00.38 CET Patrick Wintour The UK is facing accusations of double standards after formally submitting detailed legal arguments to the international court of justice in The Hague six weeks ago to support claims that Myanmar committed genocide against the Rohingya ethnic group through its mass mistreatment of children and systematically depriving people of their homes and food. The UK made its 21-page \u201cdeclaration of intervention\u201d jointly with five other countries, but it is not supporting South Africa as it prepares to try to convince the ICJ on Thursday that Israel is at risk of committing genocide against the Palestinian people. The UK submission on Myanmar argues there is a lower threshold for determining genocide if the damage has been inflicted on children as opposed to adults. The submission said other actions that could be defined as genocidal, if systematic, include forced displacement from homes, deprivation of medical services and the imposition of subsistence diets. It argues that given declarations of intent to commit genocide are rare, the court\u2019s test should not solely be explicit statements or numbers killed, but reasonable inference drawn from a pattern of conduct and factual evidence. Israel will defend itself at the UN-derived ICJ insisting it has been seeking to protect its civilian population in an attempt to destroy Hamas but not the Palestinian people. It says its postwar plans for Gaza involving Palestinian-led governance is proof of a lack of genocidal intent.

The Guardian\u2019s Jason Burke reports: Israeli defence officials and former senior intelligence officers have said they expect fighting in Gaza to continue for at least a year, raising the prospect of thousands more civilian casualties, a deepening humanitarian crisis and a continuing grave threat to regional stability. In a briefing, R Adm Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said the centre and south of Gaza, where military efforts are now focused, was \u201cdense and saturated with terrorists\u201d with \u201can underground city of branching tunnels\u201d. Three months would be needed to clear the area and fighting would \u201ccontinue during the year 2024\u201d, Hagari said. He said scattered fighting was to be expected in northern Gaza, along with rockets sporadically being launched from there toward Israel, but that Hamas militants were \u201cwithout a framework and without commanders\u201d. Maj Gen Amos Yadlin, a former head of military intelligence who is close to senior serving officers, compared the campaign to that led by a multinational coalition against Islamic State in 2017 that took nine months. But in Gaza the situation was much more challenging, he said \u201cIt will take a year to dismantle Hamas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not the six-day war [of 1967]. The timeline is long \u2026 [IS strongholds] Mosul and Raqqa were not fortified underground \u2026 and the coalition was 85 countries.\u201d Read the full story here: Israel says Gaza fighting could last a year, amplifying fears of regional war Read more\nUpdated at 21.19 CET\n7 Jan 2024 20.43 CET Lebanese media: Beirut airport screens hacked with anti-Hezbollah messages Beirut\u2019s airport screens were hacked on Sunday with messages that showed anti-Hezbollah messages, Agence France-Presse reports Lebanon\u2019s state news agency saying.

The Israeli Defence Forces declined to comment on the extent of the damage at Mt Meron airbase, which is less than 10km (6.21 miles) from the border with Lebanon. Images released by Hezbollah, and published by Israeli media, appeared to show a fire on or beside a dome protecting sensitive equipment at the airbase. The IDF said back-up systems meant the country\u2019s air defence systems continued to function, and it was investigating the attack to prevent similar damage in the future. Hezbollah said on Saturday it had targeted the base in response for the assassination of Hamas\u2019s deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri, who was killed by a missile strike in Beirut last week. The successful attack on a sensitive military facility underlines Hezbollah\u2019s military capacity. Israelis security officials acknowledge the group would present a far more formidable enemy than Hamas if exchanges of cross-border fire, which have continued for three months, escalate into a full conflict.\nUpdated at 20.14 CET\n7 Jan 2024 19.41 CET The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said that he will urge Israel to do more to prevent Palestinian civilian deaths in Gaza, Reuters reports. Speaking at a news conference following his meeting with Qatari prime minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, Blinken added that Palestinian civilians must be allowed to return home and not be forced to leave Gaza. Since 7 October, Israeli forces have killed nearly 23,000 Palestinians while displacing nearly 2 million survivors across the narrow strip. Blinken added that there are \u201ctoo many journalists being killed in Gaza\u201d and called the killing of Al Jazeera\u2019s journalist Wael Dahdouh\u2019s son Hamza by an Israeli strike on Sunday an \u201cunimaginable tragedy\u201d. Journalist Mustafa Thuraya was also killed in the attack when their vehicle was struck by an Israeli missile, Al Jazeera reports. In a statement released on Sunday, the network said: \u201cWe urge the International Criminal Court, the governments and human rights organisations, and the United Nations to hold Israel accountable for its heinous crimes and demand an end to the targeting and killing of journalists.\u201d\nUpdated at 20.15 CET\n7 Jan 2024 19.00 CET In a new interview with CBS, Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, spoke of the \u201cthe unnecessarily cumbersome process going through the Israeli screening process\u201d of supplies, and \u201cthe so-called deconfliction process\u201d. Van Hollen, who recently visited the Rafah border crossing with Democratic senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, said: \u201cThere are two big things that are happening. One is the unnecessarily cumbersome process, going through the Israeli screening process, which I believe is the result of political decisions by the [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu coalition. For example, many items that should be allowed to go into Gaza, water- sort of- filtration systems, other systems like that, were in a warehouse of rejected items that we visited. While we were there, we saw a truck turned away that had a big box from UNICEF\u2026 It was a unit to help with water desalinization. It was rejected. And when one item on a truck is rejected, the entire truck is rejected. The other big issue is within Gaza, the so-called deconfliction process, which is just a fancy name for those who are providing humanitarian assistance to have the confidence that they can deliver it without being killed. And according to all the international NGOs that we talked about, who\u2019ve been operating in conflict zones around the world, they\u2019ve never seen a worse process for assuring the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance.\u201d\nUpdated at 20.22 CET\n7 Jan 2024 18.20 CET US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, toured a World Food Programme warehouse that is providing aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza, the US state department said on Sunday. \u201cWe are focused on maximizing humanitarian assistance in Gaza, and the secretary commended the extraordinary work of WFP to get more food to more people, more effectively,\u201d the US state department said.

Speaking to CNN, Anderson said: \u201cThe levels of hunger are quite severe in Gaza. From Rafah to the north, it gets worse, the farther north you go. We\u2019re making a concerted effort to try to import more food into Gaza and make sure it gets to people in need, including the 1.4 million people in the Rafah governorate. And then secondly, the hospital network in Gaza has been severely damaged. It\u2019s almost collapsed. Bed capacity is well over 300% for normal beds and well over 200% for ICU. And because of the security situation, organizations like Medecins Sans Frontier\u2026have had to evacuate hospitals where they were providing support. So for us, it\u2019s very much in life-saving mode and trying to make sure that we get things to people that they need. He added: \u201cThe largest concern I would have is, the pressure on people is extraordinary and I don\u2019t know how much more they can bear before something explodes in the southern part of Gaza within the civilian population which would impact the UN and other international humanitarians\u2019 ability to respond to the ongoing operation.\u201d \u201cPeople are trying their best to live their lives and take care of their children\u201d@ScottAnderGaza tells @CNN he doesn\u2019t know how much more people in \ud83d\udccd#Gaza can bear in these dire conditions, without sufficient food, shelter, water and any basic amenities. pic.twitter.com/QMmfCacd2E \u2014 UNRWA (@UNRWA) January 7, 2024\n7 Jan 2024 17.27 CET Crew from Medical Aid for Palestinians and the International Rescue Committee have been forced to withdraw from Gaza\u2019s al-Aqsa hospital due to Israeli bombardment.
