Your lies cover up genocide.\u201d\nBREAKING: Pro-Palestine activists are occupying the headquarters of News Corp, the media conglomerate that owns Fox News and the Wall Street Journal.\nActivists have thrown \u201cblood money\u201d onto the floor representing the conglomerate\u2019s promotion of Israeli genocide. pic.twitter.com/6NOsU0OhPR \u2014 BreakThrough News (@BTnewsroom) November 17, 2023\nPro-ceasefire demonstrators were also arrested on Friday in New York City after blocking the entrance to the headquarters building for BNY Mellon, a corporate investment company, which they said holds shares in weapons supply for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\nMeanwhile, students at Columbia University and New York University (NYU) were expected to hold a sit-in at an unnamed bank that funds NYU\u2019s Tel Aviv campus sites.\nBoth universities have campus extensions in Israel, which student organizers say are built on top of former Palestinian villages.\nThe demonstration is meant to \u201chighlight Columbia and NYU\u2019s roles legitimizing Israeli apartheid\u201d and \u201cmassive financial infrastructure \u2026 used to fund real estate projects at home and settler colonial expansions abroad\u201d, the student organization said in a press release.\nMore protests are expected on Friday and throughout the weekend in New York, Chicago and other major US cities.\nThe latest demonstration comes after 200 people in San Francisco shut down a portion of the Bay Bridge in a protest calling for a ceasefire. At least 50 people were arrested after demonstrators formed a human chain between vehicles.\nAnd at least 90 protesters were injured during a demonstration on Thursday in Washington DC on Capitol Hill. Organizers with the Ceasefire Now Coalition said that dozens of protesters sustained injuries after police violently broke up the peaceful demonstration.\nDemonstrations against Israel\u2019s airstrikes and military operations in Gaza have continued across the country, with tens of thousands of participants.\nThe latest actions come amid declining US public support for Israel in the past month, Reuters reported, citing an opinion poll.\nAccording to polling from Reuters/Ispos, the majority of Americans believe that Israel should call a ceasefire. About 68% of respondents said they agreed that \u201cIsrael should call a ceasefire and try to negotiate\u201d.\nA majority of Democratic voters also believe that Israel\u2019s overwhelming response to the 7 October Hamas attack, in which the Islamist extremists killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel and took hostages back to Gaza, is \u201ctoo much\u201d, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.\nAnd 56% of Democrats have said that Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza have been too much, which is 21 points higher than a similar survey last month.\nPeople of color in the US as well as those under the age of 45 also believe that Israel\u2019s response has been disproportionate, pointing to generational and racial splits around support for Israel.\nMeanwhile, 52% of Republicans viewed Israel\u2019s response as \u201cabout right\u201d, an increase from last month\u2019s poll when more Republicans then viewed Israel\u2019s reaction as \u201ctoo little\u201d.\nOverall, the majority of respondents say they are more sympathetic to Israelis than Palestinians.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "New York police makes arrests at Fox News HQ as Gaza protests spread", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/17/fox-news-israel-gaza-ceasfire-protest-new-york"}
