Seemingly correct, narrow-body aircraft remain the biggest demand generator for lavatories. The demand for lavatory systems in narrow-body aircraft is likely to be driven by a faster recovery in the short haul, upcoming narrow-body aircraft programs, and increased demand for narrow-body aircraft across all regions.\nWide-body aircraft, the next key segment, has witnessed a gargantuan decline amid the pandemic, followed by a slow recovery. Furthermore, the grounding of B787 and delays in the market entry of B777x dented the recovery trajectory. However, the increasing focus of OEMs towards increasing production rates of key wide-body aircraft programs (B787 and A350) serves the growing demand for the ongoing recovery of international travel.\nBased on Lavatory type- The market is segmented into the standard lavatory, modular lavatory, and customized lavatory. Standard lavatory remains the most preferred lavatory type, whereas modular lavatory is expected to be the fastest-growing product type in the market in the forthcoming years. Modular lavatories make maintenance easier and minimize aircraft downtime. Modular lavatories occupy less space while providing maximum comfort and are more useful.\nBased on end-user type- The market is segmented into OE and aftermarket. Between end-user types, the OE segment continues to dominate the market for aircraft lavatories. The key whys and wherefores behind the greater demand for lavatories at the OE level are upcoming aircraft programs and increasing production rates of key programs to support the air passenger traffic. Aftermarket on the other hand is likely to be the fastest-growing segment in the coming years.\nAfter COVID-19, passengers are more focused on opting for airlines that offer them greater hygienic and comfortable travel. Lavatory remains in the limelight when talking about hygiene and has experienced a large number of innovations amid the pandemic, particularly aiming at the greater use of sensors to develop hands-free lavatory systems. These market changes are driving the demand for lavatory systems at the aftermarket level.\nTo know the attractive segments, click here for a free sample pdf:\nhttps://www.stratviewresearch.com/Request-Sample/100/aircraft-lavatory-system-market.html#form\nWhich Region Offers the Best Opportunity and Growth?\nThe report suggests that North America is expected to remain the largest market for aircraft lavatory systems over the forecast period.\nThis growth is majorly attributed to the following \u2013\nKey commercial aircraft airframers, tier players, sub-system and component suppliers, and raw material suppliers, all have manufacturing facilities in this region.\nBoeing is the biggest procurer of aircraft lavatories in North America .\nAsia-Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing region in the market during the forecast period with China and India being the growth engines. Growing demand for commercial aircraft to accommodate expanding passenger traffic paired with the high focus on the development of commercial and regional aircraft indigenously (COMAC C919) and the opening of manufacturing facilities by key players are the most noticeable factors accountable for the highest growth of the region.\nAircraft Lavatory System Market Drivers\nSome of the key drivers listed in the report are given below.\nRising air travel and technological advancements that improve product performance.\nFor Customization or Any Other Queries, Get in Touch with Our Industry Experts at sales@stratviewresearch.com\nTop Companies in the Aircraft Lavatory System Market?\nWhile discussing the key strategies of leading companies, product development remains at the core.
