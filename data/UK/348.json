It is imperative that Congress act swiftly, as soon as possible, to advance our national security interests by helping Ukraine defend itself and secure its future,\u201d Mr Blinken added.\nThe arms package announced by the Biden administration could be the last bit of US assistance provided for Kyiv\u2019s fight against Russia, as many Republicans continue to oppose further support to Ukraine because it would be counted as a win for Mr Biden in an election year.\nEarlier this month, Mr Biden slammed House and Senate Republicans for appearing to do the bidding of the Russian government by blocking the supplemental appropriations bill he called for in October to allocate billions of dollars towards Ukraine\u2019s defence against Russia\u2019s invading forces.\nSpeaking alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a 12 October press conference at the White House, Mr Biden said the US was \u201crapidly coming to an end of our ability to help Ukraine\u201d without passage of the supplemental spending bill, and he warned that Russian president Vladimir Putin was \u201cbanking\u201d on US legislators not being able to agree to advance the funding bill.\n\u201cMoscow celebrated when Republicans voted to block Ukraine aid last week \u2014 a host of a Kremlin run shows literally said and I quote: \u2018Well done Republicans, that\u2019s good for us,\u2019\u201d Mr Biden recalled, apparently referring to a recent Daily Beast report detailing the gleeful reaction to the GOP\u2019s intransigence on Russian state television.\nThe president added: \u201cIf you\u2019re being celebrated by Russian propagandists, it might be time to rethink what you\u2019re doing\u201d.\nHouse and Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats have been at an impasse over the GOP\u2019s demand that Mr Biden agree to draconian changes to US immigration policies meant to make it more difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 for largely non-white immigrants from South and Central America and other countries to claim asylum at the US-Mexico border or receive protection from removal from the country.\nThe GOP hostage-taking, which is reminiscent of other Republican-induced crises over funding for the US government and the federal debt ceiling, has held up funding for multiple US defence priorities in recent weeks.\nAdditionally, some Republicans in both chambers remain intractably opposed to appropriating further defence aid to Kyiv because it would be seen by their political base as a win for Mr Biden, and because many GOP voters believe conspiracy theories espoused by former president Donald Trump and his allies, who claim that Mr Biden\u2019s steadfast support for Ukraine stems from alleged bribes paid to him through his son, Hunter Biden.\nThere is no evidence to support any such claims of corruption, but some GOP members have cited the outlandish theories to justify their lack of support for further aid to Kyiv.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Biden authorises final $250m aid package for Ukraine after Congress fails to approve more funds", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-ukraine-aid-package-war-russia-b2470162.html"}
