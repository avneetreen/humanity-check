Leadership is about doing the right thing. That is the least the public deserves. And the least that leadership demands.\u201d\nMajor rebellion for Starmer\nMs Phillips, the shadow domestic violence minister, defied the party whip along with Paula Barker, Rachel Hopkins, Afzal Khan, Sarah Owen, Yasmin Qureshi, Naz Shah and Andy Slaughter.\nTwo parliamentary private secretaries, Dan Carden and Mary Foy, also left their posts.\nIn a letter to Sir Keir, Ms Phillips said: \u201cI must vote with my constituents, my head, and my heart which has felt as if it were breaking over the last four weeks with the horror of the situation in Israel and Palestine.\n\u201cI see no route where the current military action does anything but put at risk the hope of peace and security for anyone in the region now and in the future.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Jess Phillips among eight frontbenchers to defy Starmer over Gaza ceasefire", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2023/11/15/rishi-sunak-latest-news-suella-braverman-pmqs/"}
