A report by Peace Now found that settlers have established a record number of nine unauthorised settlement outposts since the start of the war in October. The group\u2019s team said it had also documented the creation of more than a dozen new dirt paths and roads. \u201cThe three months of war in Gaza are being exploited by settlers to establish facts on the ground,\u201d the report said. The group said that settlers were \u201cdisregarding the legal status of the land\u201d by constructing outposts on private Palestinian lands and restricting Palestinian movement in the West Bank. The report continued: The permissive military and political environment allow the reckless construction and land seizure almost unchecked, with minimal adherence to the law. The result is not only physical harm to Palestinians and their lands but also a significant political shift in the West Bank. Most of the new outposts consist only of a few tents and an Israeli flag, the report said. But many such outposts have evolved into more permanent developments over the years. Israel\u2019s coalition government is dominated by supporters of the settler movement, including those who want to annex some or all of the West Bank. Most countries view all settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem to be a violation of international law.\nUpdated at 00.38 CET\n5 Jan 2024 00.45 CET The UN\u2019s migration agency has launched an urgent appeal for $69m (\u00a354m) to support its response to rising and critical humanitarian needs in the occupied Palestinian territories. In a statement, the International Organization for Migration (IMO) said hundreds of thousands of civilians need aid desperately, but that getting help to them continues to be hampered by \u201clong clearance procedures for humanitarian aid trucks at the border (and) the intense ground operation and fighting\u201d. \u201cFrequent disruption\u201d to communication networks has also prevented humanitarian aid coordination, it said, as has \u201cinsecurity, blocked roads and scarcity of fuel\u201d.\nUpdated at 00.52 CET\n5 Jan 2024 00.18 CET Watchdog warns of 'unprecedented surge' in unauthorised Jewish settlements in occupied West Bank While the world\u2019s attention has been focused on war in Gaza, Jewish settlers have quietly carried out an \u201cunprecedented surge\u201d of unauthorised moves in the occupied West Bank, an Israeli watchdog group has warned.

In a social media post, Rwanda\u2019s foreign ministry said the report \u2013 which we reported earlier \u2013 was \u201ccompletely false\u201d, adding that: No such discussion has taken place either now or in the past, and the disinformation should be ignored.\nUpdated at 00.36 CET\n5 Jan 2024 23.41 CET The Democratic Republic of the Congo has denied a report that it is in talks with Israel over taking in thousands of Palestinians from Gaza. According to a report in Zman Israel, the Israeli government has been conducting secret talks with multiple countries regarding a \u201cvoluntary\u201d migration scheme for Palestinians. \u201cCongo will be willing to take in migrants,\u201d a senior source in the security cabinet told the outlet. But a spokesperson for the Congolese government said there has \u201cnever been any form of negotiation, discussion or initiative\u201d with Israel about taking in Palestinian migrants, the Times of Israel reported. The paper also cited a senior Israeli official dismissing the report as a \u201cbaseless illusion\u201d. \u201cIsrael is not conducting any talks with any country on this issue,\u201d the official said.\nUpdated at 23.54 CET\n5 Jan 2024 23.24 CET The head of the World Health Organization has warned of the number of people in Gaza who have suffered \u201clife-changing\u201d amputations as a result of the war. In a social media post, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the lack of treatment and experts means that people \u201care having all or parts of their arms and legs removed, sometimes with insufficient and anesthesia and pain relief\u201d. He said the WHO is working with local partners in Gaza to deliver supplies and assess needs, but that \u201cmuch more is required\u201d, adding that \u201cthis suffering needs to end\u201d. The war in #Gaza has caused many people, of all ages, to suffer life-changing amputations.\nMany people are only able to receive care several days after their injuries occurred, reducing the possibility of saving their limbs.\nThe lack of treatment and experts means people are\u2026 pic.twitter.com/aUyAfP5OwS \u2014 Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) January 5, 2024\nUpdated at 23.56 CET\n5 Jan 2024 23.10 CET The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has said it is \u201cappalled\u201d by the \u201ccontinuous\u201d shelling of al-Amal hospital and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) headquarters in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. In a statement on Friday, the IFRC said these strikes had resulted in the loss of innocent civilian lives, including a five-day-old infant. One of the group\u2019s volunteer medics was injured in the strike, it said, in addition to 26 others who have been injured since 7 October and four colleagues who have been killed in the line of duty. Al-Amal hospital, one of the few still functioning in the south of the Gaza Strip, is marked by the Red Crescent emblem, it said, which \u201cguarantee[s] protection in times of conflict and disaster\u201d. The continuous bombardments have disrupted PRCS ambulances and paramedics, hindering vital medical aid and basic lifesaving emergency care. Access to medical care is a basic right, and blocking these services is unacceptable.\nUpdated at 23.57 CET\n5 Jan 2024 22.56 CET Former US vice-president Mike Pence has visited the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) northern command near Israel\u2019s border with Lebanon on Friday. During his visit, he received an operational update and met with reserve soldiers, according to an IDF statement. Traveled to Israel\u2019s Northern Command today to meet with military leaders and joined @IDF soldiers stationed near Israel\u2019s border with Lebanon.

Speaking to CNN, Colonna said: It\u2019s not up to Israel to determine the future of Gaza, which is Palestinian land. We need to return to the principle of international law and respect it. Her comments came after two far-right Israeli ministers earlier this week called for the resettlement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. On Wednesday, Israel\u2019s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, doubled down on a call for \u201cvoluntary emigration\u201d by Palestinians from Gaza. Israel\u2019s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, on Monday called for promoting \u201ca solution to encourage the emigration of Gaza\u2019s residents\u201d. Such calls are \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201cbrings us away from a solution,\u201d Colonna said, adding that such rhetoric is also against the long-term interests of Israel. She added: Gaza is Palestinian land, which wants to become part of the future Palestinian state. We support the two-state solution, which is the only viable option. Gaza and the West Bank must together be part of the future Palestinian state.\nUpdated at 23.02 CET", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Unauthorised Jewish settlements surge in occupied West Bank, says watchdog - as it happened", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jan/05/middle-east-crisis-live-updates-antony-blinken-israel-palestine-gaza-hamas"}
