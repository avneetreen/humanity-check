So far we have killed 8,000 \u2013 that is about a third.\n'Our end-game is to restore security and stability to Israel. We will protect our forces and our country. We will not live under threat \u2013 we have an obligation to our country.'\nLt-Col Lerner added that Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon was firing anti-tank guided missiles, drones and rockets into Israel every day, which could lead to an all-out war between the two sides.\n'There are 50 to 60 different daily incidents from the Lebanese border,' he said. 'They are risking the stability of the region. Hezbollah needs to look closely at what is going on in Gaza, and if they continue they will bear full responsibility.'\nThe offensive came amid a furious diplomatic row between Israel and South Africa after it accused Tel Aviv of carrying out genocide against Palestinians. South Africa also urged the International Court of Justice at the Hague to order a halt of attacks.\nIn response, the Israeli government said it 'rejected with disgust' the genocide claims, and in turn accused South Africa of collaborating with Hamas terrorists.\nA view of the damaged buildings and cars as residents search for their belongings among the rubble after Israeli attack on Nuseirat refugee camp in Deir al-Balah, Gaza\nSmoke billowing over Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip during the Israeli bombardment, on December 30, 2023\nIsrael's air and ground offensive against Hamas has displaced as much as 85 per cent of the Gaza Strip's 2.3 million residents", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Israeli army is locked in street battles in Hamas stronghold as Tel-Aviv also launches strikes on Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and Syria", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12913623/Israeli-Hamas-Tel-Aviv-Iran-Hezbollah-Lebanon-Syria.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"}
