Local civil defense and hospital officials said seven people were wounded, including two women, one of whom was in critical condition.\nVideo from the scene showed a passenger sedan in flames next to a small truck stopped in the middle of the road.\nThe Israeli military did not comment on the strike.\nSince the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7, Hezbollah forces have engaged in near-daily clashes with Israeli troops along the border.\nWhile the clashes had previously been limited mainly to a narrow strip within a few kilometers (miles) from the border, Israel in recent weeks appears to have moved to a strategy of targeted killings of figures from Hezbollah and allied groups, sometimes hitting in areas relatively far from the border, as was the case in Sunday\u2019s strike.\nOn Saturday, another strike near the Lebanese port city of Tyre killed two people in a car \u2014 one of them a Hezbollah commander \u2014 and two people in a nearby orchard. The commander, Ali Hudruj, was buried Sunday in south Lebanon. The other occupant of the car, tech sector businessman Mohammad Baqir Diab, was identified as a civilian and was buried in Beirut on Sunday.\nOn Jan. 2, a presumed Israeli airstrike killed a top Hamas official, Saleh Arouri, in a suburb of Beirut, the first such strike in Lebanon\u2019s capital since Israel and Hezbollah fought a brutal one-month war in 2006.\nSpeaking at Hudruj\u2019s funeral Sunday, Hezbollah Member of Parliament Hussein Jeshi said Israel had \u201cresorted to the method of assassinating some members of the resistance\" to compensate for being unable to reach a military victory against Hamas after more than 100 days of war in Gaza.\nThe Lebanese militant group said in a statement later Sunday that it had launched an attack against the town of Avivim in northern Israel in retaliation for a civilian woman killed in the Israeli strike in Kafra and for other \u201cattacks that targeted Lebanese villages and civilians.\u201d\nIt later modified the statement to remove the reference to the civilian death after hospital officials and family members said the woman was still alive.\nIsrael did not comment on the strike in Kafra but announced it had struck Hezbollah targets in several locations in Lebanon on Sunday. It later said that an anti-tank missile had hit a house in Avivim and no injuries were reported.\nWith dangers of a regional conflict flaring on multiple fronts, officials from the United States and Europe have engaged in a flurry of shuttle diplomacy in recent weeks between Israel and Lebanon, attempting to head off an escalation of the conflict into a full-on war on the Lebanese front.\n___\nSewell reported from Beirut. Associated Press journalists Ahmad Mantash in Sidon, Ali Sharaffedine in Beirut and Melanie Lidman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Strike kills Hezbollah official in Lebanon, amid apparent Israeli shift to targeted killings", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/hezbollah-ap-lebanon-israeli-sidon-b2482328.html"}
