Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock\n\u201cCritical to ending once and for all the cycle of violence \u2026 is the realisation of Palestinian political rights. That was a very clear message wherever I went,\u201d said Blinken, who has visited Turkey, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on his tour of the region.\nBlinken\u2019s tour is aimed at reaching a consensus on Gaza\u2019s future and stopping an escalation of the war across the Middle East.\nEarlier in the day, US officials said Blinken told Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, that his forces must avoid inflicting further harm on civilians in Gaza.\nMatthew Miller, a state department spokesperson, said Blinken had reaffirmed US support for Israel\u2019s attempts to stop any repeat of the Hamas attack of 7 October but \u201cstressed the importance of avoiding further civilian harm and protecting civilian infrastructure in Gaza\u201d.\nHowever there was no sign of any let-up in the violence in Gaza nor across the disputed border between Israel and Lebanon, where there have been intensifying clashes for weeks between Israel and Hezbollah, the militant Islamist organisation.\nHezbollah targeted a key Israeli base on Tuesday, declaring the attack part of its response to recent high-level Israeli assassinations in Lebanon.\nShortly afterwards, Israel killed four more Hezbollah members, including one at the funeral of a senior commander in the group\u2019s elite Radwan force who had been killed the day before.\nView image in fullscreen A woman photographs the burned out car used by the senior Hezbollah commander Wissam Tawil, who was killed in Kherbet Selem village, south Lebanon, on Monday. Photograph: Hussein Malla/AP\nIsrael has traded cross-border fire with Hezbollah for three months and, though analysts say both sides want to avoid a war, a minor miscalculation by either side could trigger a wave of violence across the Middle East.\nIn Gaza, there were reports of multiple airstrikes overnight in Khan Younis and Rafah, the biggest cities in the south of the territory, which are both crowded with internally displaced people.\nAt least 23,210 people, mostly women and children, have been killed during Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, according to its health ministry. Swaths of the territory have been devastated, with most of its 2.3 million population displaced and facing an acute humanitarian crisis.\nThe Israeli army described \u201cexpanded ground operations including airstrikes\u201d in Khan Younis, and said nine soldiers had been killed in battle in Gaza, some of the heaviest losses announced since Israel launched its offensive after the Hamas attacks that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians.\nHamas also took about 250 hostages. Israel says 132 of them remain captive, though at least 25 of these are thought to have been killed.\nIsrael\u2019s military casualties in its offensive have reached 185. Six of those who died on Monday did so in a single explosion when trying to destroy a tunnel dug by Hamas under central Gaza\u2019s al-Bureij refugee camp. The blast may have been caused by a shell fired from an Israeli tank, local media reported.\nBlinken voiced hope that, after the war, Israel could push on with its efforts towards regional integration, following its US-brokered normalisation deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and other states.\nHe also dismissed a case filed by South Africa against Israel at the international court of justice accusing it of genocide. Blinken called the allegations \u201cmeritless\u201d and said they distracted from efforts to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza. It was \u201cparticularly galling\u201d as Hamas had called for Israel\u2019s annihilation, he added.\nThe US has offered staunch support to Israel since the outbreak of its war with Hamas three months ago, but Netanyahu\u2019s refusal to offer detailed public plans for the governance of Gaza when Israel\u2019s military offensive ends has angered Washington.\nNetanyahu, whose hold on power depends on far-right support, has ignored US pressure to rein in ministers who have called for the mass voluntary emigration of Palestinians from Gaza. Washington has said such rhetoric is \u201cinflammatory and unacceptable\u201d.\nBlinken said he was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that Palestinians must be able to return to their homes \u201cas soon as conditions allow\u201d and said the US rejected any proposal for settling them outside the territory.\n00:00:53 Palestinians 'must not be pressed to leave Gaza', says Antony Blinken \u2013 video\nIsmail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, said on Tuesday that the 7 October attack \u201ccame after an attempt to marginalise the Palestinian cause\u201d and called on Muslim states \u201cto support the resistance with weapons, because this is \u2026 not the battle of the Palestinian people alone\u201d. Haniyeh was speaking in Qatar, where he is based.\nViolence has also surged in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli police confirmed three people were killed on Monday during a raid on Tulkarm to arrest a \u201cwanted terrorist\u201d.\nIsraeli army raids and settler attacks in the West Bank have killed at least 333 people since 7 October, according to the Ramallah-based Palestinian health ministry.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Antony Blinken tells Israel: Palestinian rights are key to peace", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/violence-in-gaza-persists-as-antony-blinken-seeks-consensus-in-middle-east"}
