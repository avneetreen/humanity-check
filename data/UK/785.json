Now she could do little other than listen to his despair down the line as Israel\u2019s air force struck again and again.\n\u201cHe was feeling really helpless and feeling frustrated,\u201d said Shaheen, who works for the disability charity Humanity & Inclusion. \u201cHe told me \u2018I\u2019m really regretting that I moved from the north to the south, because now the bombing this morning is targeting the south. I am afraid we will get killed after being forced to flee our home\u2019.\u201d\nThe fear \u2013 and distrust \u2013 had spread to her two sons, 12 and 10, she said, because they had been told by their parents it would be safer in the south, after Israel demanded the evacuation of the north in October. \u201cNow they are not trusting even what we are telling them. So it really impacts the psychological situation of our children,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, another relative, an uncle, had put it more succinctly: \u201cWhat we wish now is to be killed, to avoid going through all this feeling of threat all the time and being in that distress.\u201d As the war restarts, hope is running out.\nIsrael\u2019s military said on Saturday it had bombed 400 targets in the first 24 hours of its renewed campaign against Hamas on the Gaza Strip, including 50 in Khan Younis, the southern city that is now the focus of its attacks.\n00:01:34 Strikes on Gaza resume after Israel accuses Hamas of breaking truce \u2013 video\nReports from the city said that, while it had been attacked before, it was coming under its heaviest bombardment yet, while Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health said that at least 193 Palestinians had been killed and 650 wounded in Gaza since the collapse of the truce.\nAn official video from the Israel Defense Forces released on Saturday showed a string of bombings against combatants and infrastructure. In some cases whole buildings, such as one described as a \u201cHamas military command centre\u201d, are engulfed in flames, apparently hit by heavy bombs able to destroy a block of flats.\nFilm shot by photojournalist Yosef Basam showed the terrifying intensity of the attacks on Saturday morning, a succession of loud explosions in the north of the territory captured from a distance. A day earlier, an Al Jazeera video report showed a bombed-out neighbourhood of Khan Younis, where local people said 10 homes had been destroyed.\nLeaflets dropped by Israel\u2019s military demanded that residents of certain districts near Khan Younis head south to Rafah, on the Egyptian border, warning that the area was now \u201ca dangerous combat zone\u201d. Footage on Saturday showed displaced Palestinians making their way south on the rubble-strewn main Salah al-Din road.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For many, this is not their first evacuation. The scale and scope of this is unprecedented,\u201d he said.\nThe aid worker said there were \u201conly two hospitals functioning, with barely any medical supplies\u201d. Fuel and aid deliveries stopped on Friday, and a modest 50 trucks were allowed through the border on Saturday. \u201cIf fuel deliveries go down to pre-truce levels, it will be insufficient to run the desalination plants and water wells\u201d on which Palestinians rely on for drinking water, he said.\nCamps and shelters are hopelessly overcrowded \u2013 in one case by 35 times, Lee said \u2013 and outbreaks of gastroenteritis and diarrhoea are becoming increasingly common in a territory where there are about 1.1 million children. Lee said he had seen one family spend a day searching desperately for baby milk for a starving child a few months old, because the mother had been killed.\nTrauma, as well as illness, is becoming a deeper problem. Shaheen said her four-year-old daughter was unwell from polluted water and had been unsettled by having to evacuate once already. \u201cShe was not eating since the beginning of the war. She\u2019s lost three kilos,\u201d Shaheen said, holding back her emotions. \u201cI can\u2019t describe her situation, to be honest.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018We now just wish to be killed\u2019: the Palestinians under fire in southern Gaza", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/02/we-now-just-wish-to-be-killed-the-palestinians-under-fire-in-southern-gaza"}
