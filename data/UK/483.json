Ted Cruz of Texas.\nThe campaign aide made the prediction as Trump tore into President Biden Monday for being the \u2018worst ally\u2019 to Israel \u2013 as Biden comes under fire for his administration\u2019s difficulty pressuring Israel to limit the impact of its war against Hamas on civilians in Gaza.\n\u2018Biden has been the worst ally to Israel that anyone's ever had, because he allowed Iran to become rich again,\u2019 Trump said Monday.\nHe laced into Biden\u2019s foreign policy generally during off-the-cuff comments at Trump National Golf Course in West Palm Beach, where his campaign team was briefing reporters about his effort to regain the White House, and where Trump pledged not to let his primary polling lead slip away due to excessive caution.\nTrump said 'the worst president ever \u2013 ever \u2013 for Israel is Biden because he allowed Iran to get rich.'\n\u2018And one thing I learned about Biden is whatever he says, do the opposite, because he's the worst person I've ever seen on foreign policy,\u2019 Trump said. He was asked about growing pressure on the Biden administration over the war amid Israel's continued attacks on Gaza since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was in Israel Monday for talks.\nIsrael's President Benjamin Netanyahu is also facing internal pressures after the Israel Defense Forces acknowledged the accidental killing of three Israeli hostages inside Gaza days ago.\nCampaign officials limited the comments that reporters were able to put on the record, during a brief Q&A that commenced when Trump dropped into a conference room after playing a round of golf, sporting his signature red 'Make American Great Again' cap.\n'Just shot a 71 so I can't be cognitively impaired,' Trump joked.\nHe also commented on his former lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u2019s fate, days after a Washington, DC jury turned in a $148 million award for defaming two Georgia election workers during Trump's the election overturn effort in the state.\n\u2018I think it's so sad, what's happened to Rudy,\u2019 Trump said in response to a question from DailyMail.com. \u2018He's a great patriot he's the greatest mayor in the history of New York. I think it's a very, very unfair situation.'\nNikki Haley has also seen a surge in recent polls, and has leapfrogged DeSantis to second in some of the crucial early state surveys\nFormer President Trump tore into his predecessor, and vowed not to play 'prevent defense' in the primaries while sitting on a lead\nHe spoke while the administration is under pressure for Israel's war on Hamas\nHe didn't say whether he would provide any financial assistance to help Giuliani with staggering legal bills, while also serving as a defendant in other cases. The former New York mayor has vowed to appeal, and the judge in the case has the ability to try to adjust the award, which included punitive damages.\nTrump's comments came after a weekend where he spoke at a New Hampshire and doubled down on prior comments that immigrants are 'poisoning the blood of our country,' despite critics calling the comments xenophobic.\nAt the event he also brought up approving comments from Hungary's President Viktor Orban and quoted Russian President Vladimir Putin, after taking heat for his 'dictator' comments in a sit-down with Sean Hannity.\nThe comments drew a rebuke form the Anti Defamation League, and the White House slammed him for 'echoing the grotesque rhetoric of fascists and violent white supremacists.'\nIn his Israel comments, Trump referenced the scrapped Iran nuclear deal, and said Tehran lacked the financial influence during his tenure.\n'They were broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. They had no money for anything they wanted to survive.'\nHe said Biden 'allowed Iran to get rich' and said Hamas was 'out of business.'\nThe New York Times reported on Sunday that Israel in 2018 obtained intelligence showing that Hamas had amassed a financial portfolio valued a half a billion dollars, but that U.S. and Israeli intelligence had failed to act decisively on the information.\nTrump is also looking ahead to Iowa, with the caucuses less than a month away. Polls show him leading Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis by more than 30 points.\nHe said it looks like the campaign is 'doing pretty well' but 'you never know, right?'\n'You know what it is to play a certain defense called prevent defense in the NFL? We won't play prevent. ... We don't want to play prevent defense,' he said \u2013 in reference to a conservative style of play that can sometimes lead to pulse-raising deep throws down the field when a team is sitting on a lead during the final minutes of a football game.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Donald Trump will clinch the Republican nominee for president by MARCH 19, his campaign says", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12881103/Donald-Trump-clinch-Republican-nominee-president-MARCH-19-campaign-says.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"}
