Mohammed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in the territory, said Israeli soldiers entered the emergency department and the surgery building, which also contains intensive care units. An official at the Hamas-run health ministry told AFP he could see \u201cdozens of soldiers and commandos inside the emergency and reception buildings\u201d.\nWitnesses who spoke to the BBC and AFP said Israeli soldiers used loudspeakers to demand that all males aged between 16 and 40 leave every part of the hospital complex other than the surgical and emergency wings and enter the hospital courtyard.\nView image in fullscreen IDF soldiers during a military operation around at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.

The Israeli army released video showing soldiers carrying boxes labelled \u201cbaby food\u201d and \u201cmedical supplies\u201d.\nA spokesperson for the Palestinian ministry of health in Gaza, Ashraf al-Qudra, told Al Jazeera Arabic that \u201conly doctors, patients and displaced people\u201d were present when Israeli forces entered the hospital\u2019s emergency department. \u201cWe have nothing to be afraid of or hide,\u201d he said.\nOmar Zaqout, who works in the emergency room at al-Shifa, told Al Jazeera that Israeli soldiers had detained and assaulted some men who had taken refuge there. \u201c[They] did not bring any aid or supplies, they only brought terror and death,\u201d he said.\nThe IDF described the raid as \u201ca precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa hospital, based on intelligence information and an operational necessity.\u201d\nThe Israeli authorities have long maintained that Hamas uses the area below the hospital as a command centre. Hamas and hospital staff deny this.\nThe IDF said in a briefing that soldiers found \u201cweapons and other terror infrastructure,\u201d at al-Shifa, and that they had seen \u201cconcrete evidence that Hamas terrorists used the Shifa hospital as a terror headquarters,\u201d which they intended to publish later.\nView image in fullscreen Scenes from Al Shifa hospital amid Israel's ground operation in Gaza City. Photograph: Ahmed El Mokhallalati/Reuters\nHamas said the IDF\u2019s claims were \u201cnothing but a continuation of the lies and cheap propaganda, through which [Israel] is trying to give justification for its crime aimed at destroying the health sector in Gaza\u201d.\nThe raid continued well into the afternoon, though details were scant due to a widespread telecommunications blackout, which the two major Palestinian telecoms networks said had been caused by a lack of fuel. Phone calls to staff inside al-Shifa hospital and health ministry officials across Gaza failed to connect.\nThe head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said his organisation had lost contact with medics inside al-Shifa.\nIn the late afternoon, Boursh told Al Jazeera that Israeli troops were still present in the hospital. \u201cThey are still here \u2026 patients, women and children are terrified,\u201d he said. He said the medical staff had vowed to stay with their patients \u201ctill the end.\u201d\nThe raid followed days of suffering for medics, patients and civilians sheltering inside the complex, where staff described how they had moved every patient into the hospital corridors and away from the windows, fearing gunfire. Boursh told the Guardian that some who attempted to flee al-Shifa earlier this week were surrounded by gunfire as they left the hospital grounds, and turned back.\nView image in fullscreen Israeli soldiers walk in the area of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.

The hospital had also run out of clean water, and doctors said they were subsisting on dates to survive as food supplies dwindled to nothing.\nCorpses were piled in front of the hospital, with staff too terrified to move between buildings. The UN\u2019s office for humanitarian affairs said staff at al-Shifa, for decades the linchpin of Gaza\u2019s medical system, had begun preparations for a mass grave to entomb 180 bodies in front of the facility, as there was no way for them to leave in order to bury the dead.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018All men 16 years and above, raise your hands\u2019: how al-Shifa raid unfolded", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/15/all-men-16-years-and-above-raise-your-hands-how-al-shifa-raid-unfolded"}
