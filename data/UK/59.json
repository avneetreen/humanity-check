There is severe dehydration and hunger. Patients with chronic diseases don\u2019t have the medication they need.\nHis dreams and plans \u201care lost,\u201d he said. \u201cI have nothing left but my grief \u2026 They weakened us for years and continued to unleash bullets and missiles on our lifeless bodies.\u201d\nDr Al-Najjar was the first among several Palestinians testifying in an unprecedented case against President Joe Biden, who is being sued by a group of American Palestinians and aid groups accusing him of failing to prevent genocide in Gaza under obligations to international and federal law.\nThey are asking a judge for an injunction that would halt any additional military aid or diplomatic support to Israel in its ongoing siege of Gaza, where more than 25,000 Palestinians, including more than 10,000 children, have been killed within the last 126 days, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry.\nThe judge is expected to issue a decision in the coming days.\nThe case is \u201cmonumental\u201d in that it marks the first time Palestinians have testified in federal court to the impact of US support for Israel\u2019s campaign, according to Defence for Children International - Palestine advocacy officer Miranda Cleland, whose organisation is the lead plaintiff in the case.\n\u201cSo many of these atrocities are broadcast live on social media, and everyday people around the world can see for themselves what is happening,\u201d she told The Independent. \u201cCourts move slower than the people, of course, and the people have made it clear to Biden and his administration that most Americans do not support this.\u201d\nHours before the hearing, a ruling from the International Court of Justice at The Hague urged Israel to prevent acts of genocide and to allow aid into the beleaguered strip, marking an initial step in a case brought by South Africa that laid out its accusations of Palestinian genocide, and heightened pressure against Israel by world powers to end its retaliatory devastation.\nWhite House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at the White House on Friday that \u201cit\u2019s hard to see\u201d the Biden administration changing its approach to its support for Israel following the World Court\u2019s ruling.\n\u201cThis is obviously just a provisional order by the court. We\u2019ll have to watch how the process plays out. But it\u2019s difficult to see that it alone is going to change the approach,\u201d Mr Kirby said. \u201cThe president believes the approach we have been taking has been getting results and we\u2019re going to keep at that.\u201d\nPalestinians arrive in Rafah after fleeing an Israeli ground and air offensive in the nearby city of Khan Younis on 26 January. (AP)\nThe federal lawsuit against Mr Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken was filed in November by the Center for Constitutional Rights on behalf of Dr Al-Najjar with aid groups Defence for Children International \u2013 Palestine and Al-Haq, as well as plaintiffs with families in Gaza, all of whom have lost loved ones from Israel\u2019s attacks or are among the tens of thousands who have been violently displaced.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this. We would never have imagined something like this,\u201d said plaintiff Ahmed Abofoul, who was born and raised in Gaza and works as a legal researcher for Palestinian civil rights group Al-Haq.\n\u201cWe heard stories about the Nakba \u2026 I never imagined we would live it and witness it ourselves,\u201d he told the court on Friday. \u201cThe Gaza that we know no longer exists. Everything has been destroyed. \u2026 Every place I have memories with has been destroyed.\u201d\nHis neighbourhood and the walls where families wrote messages over the years, the churches where he celebrated friends\u2019 weddings, and the city archives preserving Gaza\u2019s history have all been destroyed, he said.\nIsraeli forces have killed several members of the family of Leila El-Haddad, a mother of four in Maryland who writes about Gaza\u2019s culinary heritage.\n\u201cI felt it was my duty as an American whose taxes and government have been directly responsible for the deaths of my family\u2026 to do what I can to put an end to this genocide,\u201d she told the court on Friday.\nNews of the devastation, attempts to contact her remaining family in Gaza, and her pleas to end the violence have \u201cconsumed every aspect of my life,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI spend my days just\u2026 it all revolves around this,\u201d she said.\nMohammed Monadel Herzallah of Fairfield, California, has lost at least seven members of his family, one of whom was a four-year-old girl.\n\u201cI feel horrible. I feel dehumanised \u2026 and the world is numb about it,\u201d he said in his testimony.\n\u201cI\u2019m asking this court to raise the voice of our people in Gaza, hold people who are responsible and who have the authority and duty to hold them responsible, the ability to stop this madness, to stop this genocide,\u201d he said.\nSmoke billows after an Israeli strike in Rafah in southern Gaza on 26 January. (AFP via Getty Images)\nUS District Judge Jeffrey S White, in laying out the facts of the case before him on Friday, described Israel\u2019s \u201cbrutal\u201d campaign that has killed \u201ctens of thousands of Palestinian civilians,\u201d displaced more than 2 million people, destroyed \u201ccritical civilian infrastructure\u201d, levelled hospitals, schools, and \u201csafe havens\u201d, while people are \u201cliving in fear\u201d without food, medical care, clean water or sufficient aid.\nThe United States has \u201cprovided substantial support to Israel\u201d and continued to \u201creinforce\u201d its support for Israel in the wake of Hamas attacks that killed more than 1,200 people on October 7, he said.\nBut the questions before the judge involve the limitations of the court\u2019s reach, and whether the courts are constitutionally restricted against \u201cpolitical questions\u201d of White House foreign policy.\nThe plaintiffs, however, argue that the case has nothing to do with political questions, but whether the courts can intervene if US officials have violated international and federal law.\n\u201cHere the United States is choosing to avoid its binding legal obligations,\u201d according to Center for Constitutional Rights attorney Katherine Gallagher.\nThe court must have legal discretion to act against genocide, under both the terms of the Genocide Convention and US law adhering to it, she told the court on Friday.\nJean Lin, an attorney for the US Department of Justice, argued the court has no jurisdiction whatsoever.\n\u201cWe submit that the court has no jurisdiction \u2026 even though we concede Genocide Convention is the law of the land,\u201d she told the judge. \u201cBut \u2026 that elevated status does not mean that it may be enforced by the courts.\u201d\nJudge White asked what mechanisms, then, would anyone have to ensure the government adhered to international law.\nMs Lin argued that governments could be held accountable through the United Nations and \u201cpolitical accountability\u201d through elected members of Congress, but she conceded that the plaintiffs in this case wouldn\u2019t be able to join the proceedings at The Hague, for example.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 attorneys also noted that the US wields veto power at the United Nations Security Council, effectively being able to void any charges against it.\nDr Barry Trachtenberg, a Jewish history professor and genocide scholar at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, explained to the court how US and world governments, in the wake of the Holocaust, \u201cnow have a framework\u201d under international law to combat genocide.\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve seen in nearly every genocidal effort since, the legal actions always seem to come afterwards, they come late \u2026 and then there\u2019s an attempt to bring justice against the victims,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat makes this situation so unique is we\u2019re watching the genocide unfold as we speak. \u2026 The reason why I\u2019m weighing in is we\u2019re seeing it happen before our eyes.\u201d\nHistory shows us \u201cthere are moments of intervention,\u201d he added, \u201cand it\u2019s only afterwards that we have to have this reckoning.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Palestinians testify in federal court against Biden\u2019s \u2018complicity\u2019 in genocide", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-genocide-lawsuit-court-hearing-b2485780.html"}
