Ukrainian soldiers began training on the ships last year in Scotland.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "UK sends 2 minehunters to Ukraine as Britain and Norway seek to bolster Kyiv's navy in the Black Sea", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ukraine-ap-kyiv-norway-russia-b2462013.html"}
