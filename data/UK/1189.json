Gaza\u2019s health system \u201cis on its knees\u201d, he said. He said there have been more than 250 attacks on health centres in Gaza and 25 in Israel since the start of the conflict last month. More than 100 UN colleagues have been killed. Half of the 36 hospitals in Gaza and two-thirds of its primary healthcare centers were not functioning, he said. Those that were operating were way beyond their capacities, he said.\nUpdated at 23.24 CET\n11 Nov 2023 04.46 CET Closing summary This is where we\u2019ll pause our live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war for now \u2013 we\u2019ll resume it later in the day. Here\u2019s a rundown on the latest as it just passes 5.45am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, has said there is \u201cno justification\u201d for the Israeli bombing of babies, women and elderly people in Gaza. Macron, speaking to the BBC a day after a humanitarian aid conference in Paris about the war, called for a ceasefire in Gaza, saying it would benefit Israel. In response, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Hamas was responsible for the civilian deaths in Gaza.\nThe largest hospital in Gaza, where up to 50,000 people are sheltering, is facing bombardment, the World Health Organisation has said . Palestinian officials said Israel launched airstrikes on or near four hospitals and a school on Friday, killing at least 22 people. A WHO spokesperson said 20 hospitals in Gaza were out of action and that there was \u201cintense violence\u201d at al-Shifa hospital in the heart of Gaza City. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Israeli forces opened fire on the intensive care unit at al-Quds hospital in Gaza City.\nAn Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson has said the Israeli army is aware of the sensitivities of the hospitals in Gaza. \u201cThe IDF does not fire on hostages but if we see a Hamas terrorist we will kill him,\u201d Lt Col Richard Hecht said in a press briefing on Friday.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has urgently called for the protection of patients, healthcare workers and medical facilities in Gaza. An ICRC statement warned that Gaza\u2019s healthcare system had \u201creached a point of no return\u201d amid escalating violence that had \u201cseverely\u201d affected hospitals and ambulances working in the besieged territory.\nThe number of people killed in Gaza by Israeli military actions since the start of the war on 7 October has risen to 11,078, including 4,506 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry on Friday. Another 27,490 Palestinians in Gaza had been wounded, it said.\nIsrael has revised downwards the death toll from last month\u2019s Hamas attacks in the south of the country from 1,400 to about 1,200, a foreign ministry spokesperson said. The revision was \u201cdue to the fact that there were lot of corpses that were not identified and now we think those belong to terrorists \u2026 not Israeli casualties\u201d, they said on Friday.\nThousands of Palestinians continued to flee south from northern Gaza on Friday a day after the White House announced that Israel would begin to implement four-hour \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d in parts of the area to allow people to leave. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said on Friday that more than 100,000 residents had fled south from Gaza City during the past two days.\nDespite the US announcement, there have been no immediate reports of a lull in fighting in northern Gaza. The Israeli military has said there would be \u201ctactical, local pauses for humanitarian aid for Gazan civilians\u201d but \u201cno ceasefire\u201d. On the ground, conditions continued to deteriorate as night fell over Gaza City on Friday during a sustained Israeli onslaught with heavy gunfire, explosions and the buzz of Israeli military drones heard.\nThe head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said a child was killed every 10 minutes in Gaza. \u201cNowhere and no one is safe,\u201d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the UN security council on Friday, adding that Gaza\u2019s health system was \u201con its knees\u201d, with half of its 36 hospitals not functioning.\nThe UN\u2019s human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, has called for an investigation into what he described as Israel\u2019s \u201cindiscriminate\u201d bombardment and shelling in densely populated areas in the Gaza Strip . \u201cThe extensive Israeli bombardment of Gaza, including the use of high-impact explosive weapons in densely populated areas ... is clearly having a devastating humanitarian and human rights impact,\u201d T\u00fcrk told reporters in Jordan.\nThe US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said \u201cfar too many Palestinians had been killed\u201d in the war. He said that while the US \u201cappreciates\u201d Israel\u2019s steps to minimise civilian casualties, it was not enough. Blinken said the US had proposed additional ideas to the Israelis, including longer \u201chumanitarian pauses\u201d and expanding the amount of assistance getting into Gaza.\nIsrael\u2019s embassy to the US has issued a rare public rebuke to a State Department office that deals with Palestinian affairs , after it criticised Israel\u2019s demolition of a Palestinian home in Jerusalem. The US Office of Palestinian Affairs posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday that the demolition was \u201cin response to the actions of their 13-year-old child\u201d and that \u201can entire family should not lose their home because of the actions of one individual\u201d. The Israeli embassy shot back in response: \u201cContext is helpful: the \u201813-year-old\u2019 is a terrorist who murdered an Israeli citizen by stabbing him to death.\u201d\nEach recorded fatal Israeli airstrike on Gaza since 7 October has caused an average of 10.1 civilian deaths, a monitoring group has said, amid warnings that reported civilian casualty figures are likely to be an underestimate. The fatality average is far higher than in the three previous Israeli air campaigns in Gaza.\nCrowds of people marched through the centre of Jenin in the occupied West Bank for the funerals of Palestinians killed during an IDF raid. As the Israeli offensive in Gaza continues, violence in the occupied West Bank is escalating. Nineteen Palestinians were killed across the territory on Thursday as clashes took place with Israeli forces.\nIsrael has killed a further seven Hezbollah fighters on its northern border with Lebanon, taking the total death toll of Hezbollah fighters to 78 since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October. The group\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, will make his second speech this month on Saturday, setting out his latest thinking.\nIsrael is considering a deal for Hamas to release all civilian hostages held in Gaza, according to a report. Under one of the proposals being discussed, Hamas would release 10 to 20 civilian hostages in exchange for a brief pause in fighting, one official said. That could be followed by a release of about 100 civilians if terms were met.\nEvacuations from the Gaza Strip in to Egypt for foreign passport holders and for injured Palestinians requiring urgent medical treatment were suspended on Friday . The suspension was due to problems bringing medical evacuees to the Rafah crossing from inside Gaza, Reuters reported. The Rafah crossing was also suspended on Wednesday due to what the US state department referred to as unspecified \u201csecurity circumstance\u201d.\nSaudi Arabia will host an extraordinary joint Islamic-Arab summit in Riyadh on Saturday, the Saudi foreign ministry said . The kingdom had been scheduled to host two extraordinary summits, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit and the Arab League summit, on Saturday. The joint summit would replace the two separate gatherings, the ministry said, due to \u201cthe exceptional circumstances taking place in the Palestinian Gaza Strip\u201d.\nBritish healthcare workers in uniform protested outside Downing Street on Friday to commemorate almost 200 clinicians killed in Gaza since Israel\u2019s bombardment began. The vigil was organised to call on the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, to push for an urgent ceasefire.\nThe organisers of the pro-Palestine march due to take place in London on Armistice Day believe \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people will turn out for what they say will be one of Britain\u2019s biggest days of mass protest.\n11 Nov 2023 04.14 CET The AP report continues: More than 720,000 displaced people across the Gaza Strip were sheltering at 150 facilities run by UNRWA, as of Thursday. At shelters, the lack of water makes it hard to maintain even basic hygiene. Families are packed into a school building in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, with tents set up in the playground, washing hung up to dry in corridors and children sleeping on mats next to their worried parents. Suzan Wahidi, from Gaza City, says as many as seven people might share a mattress \u2013 if they can find one. Our children are now suffering from an epidemic. They suffer from all the diseases that you can imagine, diarrhea, vomiting, fever. There are no medicines, there is no food to provide us.

Photograph: Xinhua/Shutterstock\n11 Nov 2023 04.08 CET The Associated Press has this report on the death and misery Palestinians are describing as they flee south from the intense fighting in northern Gaza. A stream of thousands of Palestinians have taken what few belongings they can carry and made their way on foot Friday to the relative safety of the southern Gaza Strip after Israel announced an hours-long window for safe passage. One woman who was displaced from Beit Lahiya in the north, Umm al-Adhan, spoke to AP on Gaza\u2019s main highway as people trudged past heading southward. She said she had been sheltering in a school run by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. She said: Yesterday, as we were leaving the school, they fired at us. Ten people were killed, including my nephew. A badly wounded child begged for water in his final moments. The woman added, crying: I could not find water to give him. He died in front of me. Israel estimates that more than 850,000 of the 1.1 million people in northern Gaza have left, and later on Friday said over 100,000 Palestinians had gone south in the past two days.\n11 Nov 2023 03.28 CET Islamophobia and antisemitism have seen sharp increases across the US after the Israel-Hamas war erupted last month. According to a new report by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), the Muslim civil rights and advocacy organisation received a total of 1,283 requests for help and reports of bias between 7 October and 4 November. The spike was \u201cunprecedented\u201d, it said. Jewish communities, meanwhile, say they have also faced record-high levels of antisemitism. On 25 October, the Anti-Defamation League reported an increase of nearly 400% in antisemitic incidents reported year-on-year. From 7 to 23 October, it recorded a total of 312 antisemitic incidents, 190 of which were directly linked to the violence in Israel and Gaza.

Pro-Palestinian marches have been held in the UK capital over recent weekends, with police making almost 100 arrests for offences including supporting banned organisations and serious hate crimes. But Saturday\u2019s march promises to be more fraught as it coincides with Armistice Day, which commemorates those who have died in conflict since world war one. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, made a late plea for peaceful demonstrations, saying in a statement released late on Friday: It is because of those who fought for this country and for the freedom we cherish that those who wish to protest can do so, but they must do so respectfully and peacefully. It would be a \u201cparticularly challenging and tense weekend\u201d, Laurence Taylor, the Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner leading Saturday\u2019s operation, said on Friday. We have a full report on the demonstration here: Pro-Palestine march will be one of UK\u2019s biggest ever protests, organisers predict Read more\n11 Nov 2023 02.36 CET A doctor at the largest hospital in Gaza has described heavy bombing outside the facility going late into the night. \u201cEvery time, every minute, we hear bombing around us,\u201d orthopedic surgeon Dr Adnan Albursh of the al-Shifa hospital told the US NBC News network around midnight local time. He said there were also multiple bombardments around al-Shifa throughout the day. Many people fled from the hospital but thousands were still there, he said. We cannot evacuate the hospital because there are a lot of patients here. There\u2019s children, women, all ages. As we reported earlier, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said al-Shifa \u2013 in the heart of Gaza City \u2013 is facing a bombardment. Up to 50,000 people are sheltering there. Palestinian officials said Israel launched airstrikes on or near four hospitals and a school on Friday, killing at least 22 people. A WHO spokesperson said 20 hospitals in Gaza were out of action and there was \u201cintense violence\u201d at al-Shifa hospital.\nUpdated at 02.42 CET\n11 Nov 2023 02.04 CET Saudis to host Islamic-Arab summit Saudi Arabia will host a joint Islamic-Arab summit in Riyadh on Saturday, the Saudi foreign ministry has said. The joint meeting \u201cwill be held in response to the exceptional circumstances taking place in the Palestinian Gaza Strip as countries feel the need to unify efforts and come out with a unified collective position\u201d, Reuters reported the ministry as saying. The kingdom was scheduled to host two extraordinary summits, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit and the Arab League summit, on Saturday. The joint summit would replace the two separate gatherings, the ministry said.

It added: An entire family should not lose their home because of the actions of one individual. The Israeli embassy shot back in response: Context is helpful: the \u201813-year-old\u2019 is a terrorist who murdered an Israeli citizen by stabbing him to death. Neither side named the teenager, but Israeli media identified him as Muhammad Zalbani, who it said had stabbed to death an Israeli border policeman as he was inspecting a bus in East Jerusalem in February. The Times of Israel said the home demolition took place on Wednesday in the Shuafat refugee camp in East Jerusalem, under the protection of a large police force.

Israel\u2019s military is set to expand its ground operations into areas of the Gaza Strip where the IDF has never operated before, the Times of Israel said that Channel 12 reported. The report said the IDF is \u201cpreparing for a period of a year of fighting \u2026 in different areas \u2026 different methods, but a year of fighting to get to the fourth stage of this war: the entry of a new government in Gaza that is not Hamas and is not backed by the Iranians.\u201d There is \u201cno pressure to hurry\u201d, the report said.
