But Jabalia residents reported persistent aerial bombardment and shelling from Israeli tanks, which they said had moved further into the town on Saturday.\nA Gaza health ministry spokesman said on Sunday 166 Palestinians had been killed in the past 24 hours, taking the total Palestinian death toll to 20,424. Tens of thousands have been wounded, with many bodies believed trapped under rubble. Almost all of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people have been displaced.\nThe Israeli military said nine soldiers had been killed in the past day, bringing to 155 its published combat losses since it began its ground incursion in response to Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 rampage into Israel, in which militants killed 1,200 and took 240 hostages.\nThe daily toll was one of the highest for Israeli forces of the ground assault so far.\n\u201cThis is a difficult morning, after a very difficult day of fighting in Gaza,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday. \u201cThe war is exacting a very heavy cost from us; however we have no choice (but) to continue to fight.\u201d\nThe White House said on Saturday U.S. President Joe Biden and Netanyahu had discussed the Israeli campaign.\nBiden \u201cemphasized the critical need to protect the civilian population including those supporting the humanitarian aid operation, and the importance of allowing civilians to move safely away from areas of ongoing fighting\u201d, the White House said in a statement.\n\u201cThe leaders discussed the importance of securing the release of all remaining hostages,\u201d the White House said.\nEgyptian and Qatari mediators have been trying to break the deadlock to end the violence. A delegation of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, which also has captives in custody in Gaza, arrived in Cairo for talks with Egyptian officials over \u201cways to end the Israeli aggression on our people in Gaza\u201d, an official of the group told Reuters on Sunday.\nNetanyahu, speaking at a weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, dismissed reports that the United States had convinced Israel not to expand its military campaign.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that Netanyahu was persuaded by Biden not to attack the militant Hezbollah group in neighbouring Lebanon out of concerns it would launch an attack on Israel.\n\u201cIsrael is a sovereign state,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cOur decisions in the war are based on our operational considerations, and I will not elaborate on that.\u201d\nThe U.N. Security Council averted a threatened U.S. veto on Friday, after days of wrangling, by removing from a draft resolution a call for an immediate end to the war. The U.S. and Israel oppose a ceasefire, contending it would let Iran-backed Hamas regroup and rearm.\nWashington abstained from the final statement, which urges steps to allow \u201csafe, unhindered, and expanded humanitarian access\u201d to Gaza and \u201cconditions for a sustainable cessation\u201d of fighting.\n\u2018THE WORLD IS SICK AND INHUMANE\u2019\nIsrael has long urged residents to leave northern areas of Gaza, but its forces have also been bombarding targets in central and southern parts of the enclave.\nSix Palestinians were killed and several wounded in an Israeli air strike on a house at the Bureij refugee camp, in the centre of the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli army ordered people to evacuate and head west towards Deir Al-Balah city, medics said.\nJoudat Imad, 55, a father-of-six, had to leave an area in the Nusseirat refugee camp in central Gaza after a map published by the army marked it as a place people had to evacuate.\n\u201cI was lucky to get a tent in Rafah,\u201d he told Reuters by phone. \u201cFrom an owner of two buildings to a refugee in a tent awaiting aid \u2013 that is what this brutal war has turned us to. The world is sick and inhumane that it can\u2019t see Israel\u2019s brutality and it is helpless to stop this war of destruction and starvation.\u201d\nIn Rafah, on Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt, an Israeli air strike on a house killed two people, Palestinian medics said.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent reported an attack on one of its main bases in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. It said a 13-year-old child had been shot dead by an Israeli drone while inside the Al-Amal Hospital.\nThe Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but blames Hamas for operating in densely populated areas or using civilians as human shields, an allegation the group denies.\n\u2018TOUGH BATTLE\u2019\nYiftah Ron-Tal, a former commander of the Israeli ground forces, described the built-up Gaza battlefield as \u201cthe most complicated and fortified\u201d in the world, requiring infantry, tanks, artillery and engineer corps.\n\u201c\u2026I think what\u2019s happening now is a product of a tough battle in a condensed area and in this kind of battle, sadly, there are many losses,\u201d he told army radio.\nThe conflict has spread, as Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi forces disrupt global trade with missile and drone attacks on vessels in the Red Sea in retaliation for Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza.\nThe United States shot down four drones launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen towards a U.S. destroyer in the southern Red Sea on Saturday, bringing to 15 the number of such attacks on commercial shipping, U.S. Central Command said.\nA drone launched from Iran struck a chemical tanker in the Indian Ocean on Saturday, the U.S. Defense Department said.\nAn Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander said the Mediterranean Sea could be closed if the United States and its allies kept committing \u201ccrimes\u201d in Gaza, Iranian media reported, without elaborating.\nReuters \u2013 by Nidal al-Mughrabi and Emily Rose", "source_domain": "www.cityam.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel bombs northern Gaza; Palestinians say 166 killed in 24 hours", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.cityam.com/israel-bombs-northern-gaza-palestinians-say-166-killed-in-24-hours/"}
