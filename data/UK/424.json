The army said it had exposed the centre of a vast underground network used by Hamas to move weapons, militants and supplies throughout the Gaza Strip. Associated Press reports that the Israeli military escorted Israeli journalists into Palestine Square in the heart of Gaza City on Wednesday to show off what it described as the centre of Hamas\u2019s tunnel network. Military commanders boasted that they had uncovered offices, tunnels and elevators used by Hamas\u2019s top leaders. The military released videos of underground offices and claimed to have found a wheelchair belonging to Hamas\u2019s military commander, Mohammed Deif, who has not been seen in public in years.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said WHO and UN had undertaken another joint visit to the al-Ahli and al-Shifa hospitals in northern Gaza, delivering medical supplies and supporting women giving birth. However, colleagues struggled to describe the immense impact recent attacks have had on these health facilities, and the catastrophic conditions remaining patients and health workers face. The WHO chief also said on X (formerly Twitter) that al-Ahli had been overwhelmed with patients needing emergency care. Until two days ago, al-Ahli was northern Gaza\u2019s last hospital functioning where injured people could undergo surgery. But our team learned today that its operating theatres are no long functioning due to the depletion, or complete absence, of specialists, power, fuel, water, food and medical supplies. That has left north Gaza with no functional hospital. Only four hospitals operate at a minimum level, providing very limited care.

They included a 10-year old girl who lost her leg and had no family left to care for her, and an older man awaiting surgery for a gun wound to the chest he may never get, whose entire family had been killed. Without medicines and other essential needs, \u201call patients will die slowly and painfully\u201d, Tedros said.

Hundreds of Palestinians are being held in detention centres in southern Israel, having been arrested in military operations across Gaza since war erupted on 7 October. \u201cThe Israeli military must urgently disclose the fate and whereabouts of everyone that it has detained since 7 October,\u201d Heba Morayef, Amnesty\u2019s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement on Wednesday. Israeli forces must specify the grounds of arrest for those detained and make every effort to provide families of those in its custody with information, particularly in light of the telecommunications blackouts that have cut off Gazans. Agence France-Presse also reports that Amnesty demanded an investigation into the \u201cinhumane treatment and enforced disappearance\u201d of the detainees from Gaza. The Israeli army said on Tuesday said it was investigating the deaths of detainees arrested in Gaza. It did not provide details regarding how many detainees had died or the circumstances of their deaths. On Tuesday the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that \u201cseveral of them have died\u201d in these detention facilities. The prisoners died at the Sde Teiman base near the city of Beersheva, it said. The detainees held at that facility were \u201cblindfolded and handcuffed for most of the day and the lights are on at the facility throughout the night\u201d, the report said.
