We, the medical staff, are holding our ground. We are standing by our patients.\u201d\nIt follows Israeli takeovers at various medical facilities, which the IDF claim are used by Hamas to hide tunnels and weapons under human shields.\nIsraeli military \u2018targeting\u2019 ambulances\nIn Deir al Balah in the south, two ambulances attending to casualties were reportedly targeted by the Israeli military.\nOn Tuesday, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society shared footage showing what it said was an Israeli tank targeting the vicinity. The ambulance was seen racing away amid thuds of explosion, and blasts were seen striking the spot where it had been parked. Israel has said in the past that ambulances are used by Hamas fighters.\nAs casualties in Khan Yunis mounted on Monday night, a convoy apparently bringing a high-profile patient was seen pulling up at a hospital in the city. The footage from the scene showed uniformed officers trying to disperse the crowds and even beating several on-lookers with sticks after an unknown man stepped out of the ambulance for treatment.\nIsraeli media outlets including Channel 14 identified the man as Nizar Awadallah, a senior Hamas official who is believed to be close to Hamas leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar.\nMeanwhile, the United Nations warned on Tuesday that Israel\u2019s bombing campaign makes it impossible to set up safe zones anywhere in Gaza.\nJames Elder, UNICEF\u2019s spokesman who just returned to Egypt from Gaza, told reporters: \u201cThe so-called safe zones are not scientific, they are not rational. They are not possible, and I think the authorities are aware of this.\u201d\nLinda Al Agha and her family fled Khan Yunis two days earlier following an IDF warning and moved to Qa\u2019 al Qurein but the fighting was incessant even in that area, which is about a 15-minute drive from Rafah near the Egyptian border.\n\u201cLast night was terrible. We didn\u2019t sleep at all: 12 hours of continuing shelling and bombing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no safe place to go in the Gaza Strip. Frankly, I think they [the IDF] are forcing us out to Sinai.\u201d\nIsrael on Tuesday denied asking the World Health Organisation (WHO) to vacate its warehouse in Gaza as it was apparently about to be caught in fighting.\nThe WHO\u2019s chief earlier said his staff received 24 hour evacuation orders for a warehouse in the south and called on Israel to withdraw it. The Israeli Defence Ministry said on Tuesday it never asked the WHO to vacate the premises.\nRichard Peeperkorn, a WHO representative in Gaza said on Tuesday \u201cthe situation is getting worse by the hour\u201d as he lamented that the amount of aid allowed into the enclave was \u201cway too little\u201d.\n\u201cWe are looking at an increasing humanitarian disaster,\u201d he said.\nIn a new report on Monday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) condemned the IDF for deliberately razing farmland, orchards and greenhouses in northern Gaza, compounding concerns of food security.\nSatellite images reviewed by HRW showed IDF bulldozers carving news roads for Israeli military vehicles across the fields and orchards as large swathes of fertile land near Beit Hanoun were ruined in the initial weeks of the offensive.\nIn Israel, the families of the hostages who still remain in Hamas captivity met with the war cabinet later on Tuesday afternoon as some of them publicly urged the government to resume talks to secure the release of their relatives.\nMr Netanyahu was quoted as saying at the meeting \u201ccurrently, it\u2019s not possible to bring them all back\u201d.\nDanny Miran, father of Omri Miran who was kidnapped from a frontier kibbutz, told the Haaretz newspaper the meeting was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and that the family did not hear any solutions offered by the government to free the hostages in Gaza.\nEarlier on Tuesday, an Israeli official claimed that Hamas drugged hostages with tranquiliser pills before handing them over to the Red Cross for release during the seven-day cease-fire.\nDr Hagar Mizrahi, told the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, that the hostages were given clonazepam, which is used to help with anxiety and OCD among other mental health disorders, before they were handed over to the aid group.\nShe did not say whether the drugging had been confirmed through blood tests.\nHamas has not yet commented on the claims.", "source_domain": "www.telegraph.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Gaza fighting 'most intense' since war began as IDF enters Khan Younis", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/12/05/israel-hamas-palestine-news-latest-idf-raids-headquarters/"}
