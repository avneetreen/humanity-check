That was not some supernatural entity, but comedian Tom Houghton doing a naked shower dash.\n\u2018I\u2019m what they call a pad brat,\u2019 says the 38-year-old who \u2013 contrary to having lived in the Tower of London for six years \u2013 actually doesn\u2019t seem spoilt at all.\nFor those who don\u2019t know, \u2018pad brats\u2019 or \u2018military brats\u2019 are kids who grew up with a parent in the armed forces. Quite an unfair moniker, really. In this case, Tom\u2019s dad was the former Chief of the Defense Staff and the late Queen Elizabeth asked \u2013 when she was alive, don\u2019t worry now \u2013 if they wanted to live in the Tower of London. As you do.\nBut Tom didn\u2019t grow up there. He moved in aged 30 as a stand-up comedian hungry for material. Well, he got some alright \u2013 and now his show, It\u2019s Not Ideal, is touring the country. If you haven\u2019t spotted his ghoulish outline in the Tower of London, you might recognise him on TikTok, where he talks about just that.\nTom\u2019s new stand-up show It\u2019s Not Ideal is touring in 2024 (Picture: AEMEN SUKKAR JIKSAW)\n\u2018It was pretty eerie. The house I lived in at the time was called Queen\u2019s House \u2013 which is now King\u2019s House because we\u2019ve got a king,\u2019 Tom tells Metro.co.uk over Zoom.\n\u2018In my house was the room that Guy Fawkes was interrogated in. My bedroom was next to the bell tower which had Anne Boleyn and Lady Jane Grey and Thomas Moore in it. Lady Arabella Stuart was a young girl who died in my bedroom,\u2019 he tells me over Zoom.\nAny little, erm, ghosties of poor Arabella\u2026? (Couldn\u2019t not ask).\n\u2018I was the ghost for a while,\u2019 responded Tom. Hold up. What?\n\u2018You know when you need a shower and you walk from your bedroom naked just to save yourself getting dressed? I used to do that in the shower,\u2019 he chortled.\n\u2018The Beefeaters told me that tourists kept on seeing a naked man walking across the windows. From then on I clothed myself rather than be the naked ghost of the Tower of London.\n\u2018People don\u2019t think people live there, they think it\u2019s just abandoned. So there were TikToks going around going, \u201cI\u2019ve just seen a ghost who walked past the window,\u201d and people would comment being like, \u201cTom Houghton, is that you?\u201d\u2018\nBut while Tom has been a ghost in the, er, real supernatural sense, he\u2019s also been a ghost of himself trudging the cobbled historically-weighty paths he called home, surrounded by wide-eyed tourists.\n\u2018My walk of shame was one of the most shameful walks of shame known to man,\u2019 Tom admitted. Where most people can hide themselves, Tom\u2019s included an army of beady-eyed tourists snapping pictures of the comic, just in case this was genuinely what Prince Harry looks like after a big night. He considers this a real possibility.\n\u2018\u201dPrince Harry\u2019s looking bit a bit rough,\u201d\u2018 he joked, impersonating a tourist.\nAnd bringing someone back to his on an an evening..? At the start of his stay, Tom was a single man, and if the woman in the smoking area believed that he actually did live in the Tower of London \u2013 despite the fact this sounds like a blatant pick-up line, he admits \u2013 when they got to his, things could get complicated.\n\u2018There was quite a protocol,\u2019 Tom reflected, but quite reasonably didn\u2019t want to disclose anything that would breach the Tower\u2019s security. Absolutely fair enough, sorry Tom.\n\u2018But it\u2019s a funny thing I realised, you\u2019ve got to sign them in,\u2019 he shared. \u2018So the Beefeaters probably have a record of my dating history somewhere in the Tower.\u2019\nAlthough Tom\u2019s tales are some mega comedy Crown Jewels, he understands the historical gravitas of living in such a place.\n\u2018You realise quite quickly you\u2019ve got to be very respectful living there, because it\u2019s it\u2019s a huge privilege to have lived there,\u2019 he said.\n\u2018It\u2019s also none of my achievement. It\u2019s all my dad\u2019s. So I think maybe when I first lived there I got a bit excited, and then after a while, I realised, no, you\u2019ve got to obey the rules.\u2019\nNowadays, it would be easy to dismiss a white male comic who talks about boarding school and growing up in a very impressive pad as, well, a bit boring.\nAfter all, we\u2019ve heard it all before. And we\u2019ve heard all the satires now, too, with the likes of Josh Berry\u2019s poshboy and gal takedowns, and Jack Whitehall pretty much took the self-deprecating posho spot long ago in the mainstream.\nBut Tom isn\u2019t what he seems, and he\u2019s certainly not boring. He\u2019s the opposite to posh boys who attempt to thinly veil their wealth with their distressed garms, minimalist T-shirt businesses (yawn), greasy hair, flats in Finsbury Park and rollies bought in bulk from duty free so they can continue catch eyes with a dashing yellow Amber Leaf packet. We know the type.\nHe\u2019s a funny man, with some truly bizarre stories to tell\u2026 (Picture: AEMEN SUKKAR JIKSAW)\nTom is reflective, honest, and isn\u2019t shying away from who he is. Behind the jokes, his favourite thing about living in the Tower of London was reconnecting with his dad as an adult.\nAs well as his dad being away a lot for work, Tom was bundled off to a boarding school in the Lake District aged six. It was either that or change schools every one or two years with the military postings.\n\u2018It was quite genuinely, mentally scarring at six years old, being sent off. That\u2019s quite a young age,\u2019 Tom remembered. But all in all, it was the lesser of two evils.\nTom talks about his boarding school experience in much of his comedy, and has some interesting insights.\nThe weirdest thing about his whole experience in an all-boys boarding school was not some gross prank, or anything to do with a live animal (don\u2019t know why this springs to mind) \u2013 but Tom recalled it was when his school went co-educational, and 22 girls arrived at the gates.\nBut the result was not the celebration you\u2019d expect from 300 or so pubescent boys.\n\u2018The truth is, we were so inept dealing with it,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018We just all completely lost our minds and didn\u2019t know how to talk to them and the hierarchies all shift as well. It was like who was the toughest was the hierarchy. But now, as a kid in drama and doing musicals I was friends with all the girls, so my popularity went up.\u2019\nTom lived in the Tower of London for six years (Picture: AEMEN SUKKAR JIKSAW)\nBut there\u2019s more. \u2018When the school went co-ed they were so concerned about girls getting pregnant in the first year they introduced a five-inch rule, so you weren\u2019t allowed to be within five inches of a girl.\u2019\nThis naturally meant couples snuck off into the bushes, which caused a whole lot more drama than if they didn\u2019t try to \u2018damage control\u2019.\n\u2018The intent was to cause damage control, but it was horrendously handled,\u2019 reflected Tom, serious now.\nBefore the co-educational change, girls were introduced to the boys school in a very strange way, indeed.\nYou may have heard of boarding school children talking about \u2018socials\u2019 \u2013 those things that would happen every Saturday with the other all-girls or all-boys school, designed to let the two sexes interact.\n\u2018You\u2019d be stuck in a sports hall for three hours [with the girls\u2019 school] after playing rugby so it\u2019s a sort of like, \u201cHey, as your reward here are some girls.\u201d\u2018 And because you\u2019ve only got three hours, and you don\u2019t really know them\u2026\u2019 Tom cuts off.\n\u2018Genuinely I think lots of my friends growing up, we didn\u2019t see girls as friends. We saw them as things you\u2019re trying to kiss within three hours.\n\u2018It\u2019s a very damaging way to be introduced to women as prizes or objects, and as such, when you go into the real world so many of my friends struggled to properly form friendships and relationships with women because you never got to experience them in any sort of down to earth, relaxed friendship way.\n\u2018I think it\u2019s very, very damaging in the long run.\u2019\nWhat a clever ghost.\nTo book tickets for Tom\u2019s 2024 show It\u2019s Not Ideal, please visit his website.\nGot a story?\nIf you\u2019ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page \u2013 we\u2019d love to hear from you.\nMORE : \u2018I fed my dad to a pelican\u2019\nMORE : Katherine Ryan joins the I\u2019m A Celebrity boycott as Jamie Lynn Spears makes shock exit", "source_domain": "metro.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "'I was a naked ghost in the Tower of London'", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2023/12/02/i-a-naked-ghost-tower-london-19901928/"}
