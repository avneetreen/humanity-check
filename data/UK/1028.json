I understand your rage. But let me ask you not to let yourself be consumed by rage.\u201d\nThe diplomat also called for the \u201cimmediate and unconditional release\u201d of those taken hostage by Hamas that day.\nMacron, who was visiting Switzerland, urged an \u201cimmediate truce leading to a humanitarian ceasefire\u201d, but admitted that \u201cthere is not a united position, to be honest, at the European level\u201d.\nThe French foreign ministry spokesperson, Anne-Claire Legendre, meanwhile, accused Israeli settlers of a policy of terror in the West Bank aimed at displacing Palestinians, and urged Israeli authorities to protect Palestinians from the violence.\nThe warnings contrasted with Joe Biden, speaking after talks on Wednesday with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who defended his refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. The US president said Hamas represented a continuing threat to Israel and that Israeli forces were seeking to avoid civilian casualties. He said Israeli attacks would not stop until Hamas was no longer able to murder civilians.\n00:01:39 Biden defends rejecting calls for ceasefire: Hamas 'plan on attacking Israel again' \u2013 video\nBiden also said al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, which Israeli troops had entered earlier that day, had contained a Hamas underground command centre, justifying the raid \u2013 a claim repeated by the White House spokesperson John Kirby on Thursday.\nBiden said it was likely Hamas activity existed at other hospitals in Gaza.\nThe heads of all the main UN agencies meanwhile announced they would not participate in helping citizens of Gaza be forced into Israeli-designated \u201csafe zones\u201d unless such zones had been agreed with all the parties, saying otherwise \u201cthey could cause large-scale loss of life\u201d.\nIn a joint statement, the 18 heads of the main UN agencies said: \u201cWithout the right conditions, concentrating civilians in such zones in the context of active hostilities can raise the risk of attack and additional harm. No \u2018safe zone\u2019 is truly safe when it is declared unilaterally or enforced by the presence of armed forces.\n\u201cAny discussions around \u2018safe zones\u2019 must not detract from the parties\u2019 obligation to take constant care to spare civilians \u2013 wherever they are \u2013 and meet their essential needs, including by facilitating rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all civilians in need.\u201d\nThe head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Philippe Lazzarini, said separately he believed there was a deliberate attempt to \u201cstrangle\u201d its humanitarian work in Gaza, warning that the agency may have to suspend its operations entirely due to a lack of fuel. He said the organisation had pleaded for weeks for access to fuel, which was transported into Gaza on Wednesday for the first time since the start of Israel\u2019s war with Hamas, but it was nowhere near what Palestinians in the territory needed to survive.\nUN commissioner says killing of Gaza civilians cannot be dismissed as 'collateral damage' \u2013 video\nIsraeli forces had dropped leaflets telling Palestinians to flee parts of southern Gaza, residents told the Associated Press on Thursday, signalling a possible expansion of operations to areas where hundreds of thousands of people who heeded earlier evacuation orders in the north are crowded.\nThe leaflets, dropped in areas east of the southern town of Khan Younis, told civilians to evacuate the area and said anyone in the vicinity of militants or their positions was putting their life in danger.\nSome western officials said they feared that with more than 1.5 million Palestinians displaced from their homes in Gaza, they were going to be forced into tent cities in the south of the strip and this would put them under pressure to leave Gaza altogether, making their displacement \u201cvoluntary\u201d.\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, is expected to ask Israel to formally accept a resolution passed by the UN security council calling on Israel to accept a humanitarian pause of sufficient duration to allow aid to enter the country.\nBrett Jonathan Miller, Israel\u2019s deputy permanent representative, rejected the resolution, saying it was \u201cdetached from the reality on the ground\u201d. But Israel will feel relieved by the degree of continued support that its military received from Biden, who argued that Israeli forces had switched from aerial bombardment, which he seemed to acknowledge had been indiscriminate in parts, to more targeted ground operations, after more than 11,000 Palestinians are reported to have died.\nHe said: \u201cIt is not carpet bombing. This is a different thing. They\u2019re going through these tunnels, they\u2019re going into the hospital. They\u2019re also bringing in incubators or bringing in other means to help people in the hospital, and they\u2019ve given, I\u2019m told, the doctors and nurses and personnel the opportunity to get out of harm\u2019s way. So this is a different story than I believe was occurring before, the indiscriminate bombing.\u201d\n00:01:50 Israeli forces enter al-Shifa hospital in Gaza \u2013 video report\nWestern media on Thursday were poring over Israel\u2019s decision to send troops into Shifa hospital in Gaza, and assessing the evidence the Israeli military had so far uncovered in support of its claim Hamas had used the hospital as a command centre. On Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces released a video that they said showed some of the material recovered from a building in the hospital complex, including automatic weapons, grenades, ammunition and flak jackets.\nLt Col Jonathan Conricus, IDF spokesperson, told the BBC\u2019s World at One: \u201cHamas unfortunately has had time to prepare for our advance. It has taken us time to get there. This time, it looks like, has been put into good use by Hamas to cover its tracks. This does not mean we will not find their infrastructure because they can take away mobile items like guns. We found a few yesterday in one of the clinics.\u201d\nHe added the IDF had not yet searched the whole area and was looking for the access points to the underground infrastructure. \u201cWe are looking for tunnels within the compound and we will expand our searches, and I think in maybe a few days\u2019 or weeks\u2019 time we will be able to expose exactly what was or is under Shifa,\u201d he said.\nHamas denied the claim, which it said was \u201cnothing but a continuation of the lies and cheap propaganda through which [Israel] is trying to give justification for its crime aimed at destroying the health sector in Gaza\u201d.\nIt is widely accepted that Hamas has an extensive tunnel network across Gaza.\nAdditional reporting by Emine Sinmaz and Jason Burke in Jerusalem, and Julian Borger in Washington", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "EU foreign affairs chief tells Israel not to be \u2018consumed by rage\u2019 in response to Hamas attacks", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/16/josep-borrell-israel-response-hamas-attacks-eu"}
