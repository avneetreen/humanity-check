Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the shelling outside Donetsk a \u201cmonstrous terrorist act,\u201d and the Russia-backed local authorities declared a day of mourning.\nThe Ukrainian military, however, denied it had anything to do with the attack.\nIt was not immediately possible to verify either side's claims.\nUkraine\u2019s allies have in recent weeks sought to reassure the country that they are committed to its long-term defense against the Kremlin\u2019s forces amid concerns that Western support could be sagging. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and France\u2019s new foreign minister also traveled to Kyiv recently.\nLocated on NATO\u2019s eastern flank, Poland has been one of Ukraine's strongest allies in its fight to defeat Russia. The government in Warsaw has provided weapons and humanitarian aid, and opened its borders to Ukrainian refugees since Moscow's troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.\nBut relations soured last year as economic competition from Ukrainian food producers and truckers angered Poles who said their livelihoods were under threat.\nPolish farmers and truckers blockaded border crossings, causing backups and threatening the flow of some aid going into Ukraine.\nPolish farmers complained that imports of Ukrainian foods had caused prices to fall, hurting their incomes, while truckers said they were being undercut by their Ukrainian counterparts. The issue surfaced during the war as Ukrainian ports were blocked and food producers turned to road routes through Europe to get their products to market.\nAt one point, Poland and some other European nations banned Ukrainian grain imports because of the trade dispute.\nPoland's farmers and trucks have ended their protests for now, but Tusk is seeking ways of addressing their concerns. He has said that his country wants to help Ukraine economically but not at the expense of Polish businesses. He has suggested that Ukraine needs to better regulate its trucking industry.\nTusk was also scheduled to honor Ukrainian fighters and attend observances of the Day of Ukraine\u2019s Unity, which marks Ukraine\u2019s long struggle to be independent from both its eastern and western neighbors.\nIn other war-related developments, Ukraine\u2019s air force said it intercepted all eight Shahed drones that Russia launch overnight over southern and central regions of Ukraine.\nDebris from three drones shot down over the central Dnipropetrovsk region started a fire at an unnamed business but no human casualties were reported.\nMeanwhile, major Ukrainian digital banking platform Monobank said it came under a massive denial-of-service (DoS) attack by unidentified hackers.\nThe attack was successfully repelled, the bank said, with no major consequences.\n___\nMonika Scislowska contributed from Warsaw, Poland.\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Poland's prime minister visits Ukraine in latest show of foreign support for the war against Russia", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/donald-tusk-ap-ukraine-poland-russia-b2482584.html"}
