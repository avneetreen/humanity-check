A Qatari official told the news agency of the deal on Tuesday, with a source involved in organising the returns saying they had been staying with relatives in Russia or Russian-occupied territory. The children are en route to Ukraine via Moscow, the source added. This is the second phase of a Qatar-mediated return of children, after four minors were returned in October. Negotiations on the returns had been under way since at least April 2023, a source told Reuters in July.

Reuters said the cases appear to be different to those of Ukrainian children who Ukraine says were forcibly taken to Russia from territories occupied by Moscow, and which are the subject of an International Criminal Court case. Kyiv says about 20,000 children have been taken from Ukraine to Russia or Russian-held territory without the consent of family or guardians. It calls this a war crime that meets the UN treaty definition of genocide.\nUpdated at 13.18 CET\n5 Dec 2023 16.57 CET Closing summary Thanks for following the Russia-Ukraine war live blog today. It will be closed shortly but you can continue to follow the Guardian\u2019s latest reporting from Ukraine here. Chris Stein will be covering Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s address to the US senate later today over on the US politics live blog (he is due to speak at 8pm GMT). Below is a closing summary of today\u2019s key posts. Six children will be returned to Ukraine from Russia under a deal brokered by Qatar, according to a Qatari official. The children are en route to Ukraine via Moscow, the source said. This is the second phase of a Qatar-mediated return of children, after four minors were returned in October.\nBritish foreign secretary David Cameron has told the House of Lords that there will be no reduction in UK military support for Ukraine in 2024. The update comes after the White House yesterday warned that \u201cit is weeks away from running out of money to support Kyiv\u2019s defence against Russia\u2019s invasion\u201d.\nAt least two people were killed and one wounded after Russian forces struck the southern city of Kherson, the head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency said. Regional prosecutors opened a war crimes investigation into one of the strikes, which occurred at about 9am and killed a 48-year-old man and a woman who had not yet been identified.\nRussia claims it downed dozens of Ukrainian drones overnight. Russian air defence systems destroyed or intercepted a total of 41 Ukraine-launched drones overnight and early morning, the Russian defence ministry has said.\nUkraine\u2019s military shot down 10 out of 17 attack drones launched overnight by Russia, Ukrainian authorities said. The governor of Ukraine\u2019s western Lviv region, Maksym Kozytskyy, said three drones had struck an unspecified infrastructure target, causing a fire, but damage had been minimal and no casualties had been reported.\nUpdated at 17.00 CET\n5 Dec 2023 16.39 CET British foreign secretary says there will be no reduction in UK support for Ukraine in 2024 British foreign secretary David Cameron has told the House of Lords that there will be no reduction in UK military support for Ukraine next year. Cameron said the UK has so far provided humanitarian and economic support worth more than \u00a34.7bn to Ukraine and that it will continue to provide support. Cameron said he did not have the exact figures for next year\u2019s spending to hand, but he said support will continue at the scale it has been before, or beyond that.\n5 Dec 2023 16.34 CET Ukraine is investigating alleged corruption into arms procurement, but vowed there was no \u201cmisuse\u201d of Western weapons pouring into the country to fight the Russian invasion, AFP reports. Kyiv has for months promised its EU allies that it is still committed to fighting corruption, even during war time. The announcement comes three months after Kyiv appointed a new defence minister, Rustem Umerov, following allegations of corruption in the army during the tenure of his predecessor. \u201cThere are several proceedings related to arms procurement,\u201d Oleksandr Klymenko, the head of the anti-corruption prosecutor\u2019s office, said. He said these included contracts that amount \u201cfrom tens-to-hundreds of millions of euros\u201d, but said he could not disclose details. \u201cIt is necessary to investigate and establish specific facts: whether it happened or not.\u201d Klymenko said that authorities had not received any complaints from Western allies that have provided the country with weapons. Corruption is a major problem in Ukraine and there have been several corruption scandals in recent months, including within the defence ministry.\n5 Dec 2023 16.15 CET Lili Bayer reports that the EU is under pressure not to \u201cappease\u201d Viktor Orb\u00e1n by unfreezing billions of euros earmarked for Hungary, as the Hungarian prime minister threatens to derail EU plans to open accession talks with Ukraine and grant Kyiv fresh aid. The Hungarian government\u2019s moves in recent years to undermine independent institutions, as well as concerns about corruption and alleged misuse of European funds, have led Brussels to withhold over \u20ac27bn (\u00a323bn) earmarked for Hungary. However, in a step likely to fuel frustration among rule of law advocates, the commission has signalled that it may be prepared to unfreeze up to \u20ac10bn, ostensibly due to progress made on judicial reforms \u2026 Daniel Freund, a German Green member of the European parliament and critic of the Orb\u00e1n government, urged the EU on Monday not to let Hungary off the hook. \u201cThe Orb\u00e1n government did not fulfil the necessary reforms,\u201d he said. \u201cNo money must flow. If the commission decides otherwise, it is only for one reason: they\u2019re trying to appease Orb\u00e1n who went completely overboard with his veto threat.\u201d EU must not \u2018appease\u2019 Viktor Orb\u00e1n by unfreezing billions earmarked for Hungary Read more\n5 Dec 2023 15.54 CET British foreign secretary David Cameron said he discussed \u201cRussia\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine\u201d with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi. In a post on X, former British PM Cameron said: \u201cWe discussed our intention to have a constructive relationship, the situation in Israel and Gaza, and Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine. The UK will continue to engage with China where it furthers our interests.\u201d I spoke to China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi today.\nWe discussed our intention to have a constructive relationship, the situation in Israel and Gaza, and Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine.\nThe UK will continue to engage with China where it furthers our interests. \u2014 David Cameron (@David_Cameron) December 5, 2023\n5 Dec 2023 15.41 CET Russian oil giant Lukoil has said it would consider selling its oil refinery in Bulgaria, following a Bulgarian government plan to end imports of Russian crude oil, AFP reports. Bulgaria, a country historically close to Moscow and almost entirely dependent on Russian oil and gas imports before the war, has been seeking to free itself from this dependence. The EU member was granted an exemption from the bloc\u2019s embargo on Russian crude oil to run until the end of 2024, allowing the refinery to produce oil for the country\u2019s own consumption, export oil products to Ukraine and to a lesser extent to Europe. Bulgaria\u2019s new pro-European government is however planning for this to end by next March, according to a recent parliamentary proposal to be ratified in the coming weeks. The government has also imposed a 60% tax on the profits of the Russian oil company. In a statement on Tuesday, Lukoil slammed the \u201cadoption by the Bulgarian state authorities of discriminatory laws and other unfair, biased political decisions towards the refinery.\u201d\n5 Dec 2023 15.07 CET A growing number of Russian women are demanding the return of their husbands, sons and brothers from the frontlines of the war in Ukraine, Reuters reports. A grassroots movement has sprung in recent weeks, with women demanding the return of their loved ones from the conflict. One main outlet for the movement is the \u201cWay Home\u201d Telegram channel, which has 23,000 members. Since Maria Andreeva\u2019s husband was mobilised last year and headed to Ukraine, he has been back only for two short breaks to see his wife and young daughter. His wife says this is insufficient for a soldier fighting in a conflict. \u201cWe want our men to be demobilised so that they can return home because we think that for over a year they have done everything they could have \u2013 or even more,\u201d Andreeva, 34, told Reuters in an interview in Moscow. Petitions to bring men back have produced almost no response and Russia\u2019s defence ministry has barely engaged with the women, Andreeva said. Protests planned by the women did not secure the authorities\u2019 approval to go ahead. The women have been accused of being backed by Western-based dissidents and opposition parties \u2013 slurs without foundations, Andreeva said. The New York Times reported that the organisers of the \u201cWay Home\u201d channel published a manifesto pressing for mobilised soldiers to be sent home after a year of deployment.\n5 Dec 2023 14.53 CET Ukraine is still relying heavily on economic assistance from the west to defend itself from Russia\u2019s invasion. After yesterday\u2019s warning from the White House that it is \u201cout of money and nearly out of time\u201d to assist Ukraine, Reuters has broken down where financial aid for Ukraine is likely come from in the coming years. Ukraine\u2019s government expects a budget deficit of about $43bn (\u00a334bn) in 2024 and plans to cover it with domestic borrowing and financial aid from the west. US: Kyiv is seeking $8.5bn in aid to help cover its budget deficit. Joe Biden\u2019s administration asked Congress in October for nearly $106bn to fund plans for Ukraine, Israel and US border security, but Republicans who control the House rejected the package. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to address US senators by video link behind closed doors today in order to make the case for more Ukrainian funding. Europe: The European Union announced a \u20ac50bn (\u00a343bn) multi-year support package named the Ukraine Facility that would be delivered through to 2027. Kyiv officials have said they hope to receive \u20ac18bn of support from the facility in 2024, financing that would be crucial for covering the budget gap next year, but there is still no agreement on granting the aid inside the bloc. IMF: Ukraine\u2019s cooperation with the International Monetary Fund is important for its financial stability, Reuters reports. This year the IMF approved a new 48-month lending programme worth $15.6bn. Ukraine received $3.6 billion this year and expects another $900m in December. In 2024 the government hopes to receive $5.4bn, but each tranche is linked to a series of reform targets and economic indicators. Other packages: Ukraine also expects about $1.5bn from other international financial institutions, including the World Bank, next year. Ukraine has agreed financial support packages from Britain and Japan for 2024. It is also in talks with the governments of Canada, Norway, South Korea and others to secure other funds.\nUpdated at 14.59 CET\n5 Dec 2023 14.22 CET Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the minister of internal affairs in Ukraine, has shared a video purporting to show Russian children shooting at targets featuring the faces of Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, US president Joe Biden and Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg at a festival in the Siberian city of Tomsk. The Guardian could not independently verify the video, however, Russian state-owned newspaper AiF published a story on the video here. The story said the shooting range was set up as part of patriotic festival \u201cPeaceful Warrior of the Russian Federation\u201d, which was held on 2 December at Tomsk Municipal Construction College. In Russia, children \"learn patriotism\" while shooting at Biden, Zelenskyy and Stoltenberg.\nA festival called \"Peaceful Warrior of the Russian Federation\" was held in the Russian city of Tomsk.

According to AFP, Lolwah Al-Khater said: [Qatar has facilitated] the reunification of six additional Ukrainian children with their families in time for the festive holidays. Both sides cooperated fully and engaged in good faith throughout the process, with Qatar serving as an intermediary.

A Qatari official told the news agency of the deal on Tuesday, with a source involved in organising the returns saying they had been staying with relatives in Russia or Russian-occupied territory.

The MoD says that while Russia now likely controls most of the built-up area, Ukrainian forces remain in control of pockets of territory on the western edge of the town. Russia\u2019s renewed efforts against Maryinka are part of Russia\u2019s autumn offensive which is prioritising extending Russia\u2019s control over the remaining parts of the Donetsk Oblast \u2013 highly likely still one of the Kremlin\u2019s core war aims, according to the MoD.

It said that nearly 3,500 drones are thought to have ended up in Russia as a result. The items were approved for export to a different nation, but ultimately found their way into Russia, the authorities suspect. The customs agency said that \u201cone individual is responsible for both of the companies under investigation\u201d. One of the companies oversaw the purchasing of the sanctioned products and the other forwarded the goods to Russia, according to Finnish Customs. The case involves regulation offences and a defence materiel export offence, and will be taken over by a prosecutor in December.\nUpdated at 12.02 CET\n5 Dec 2023 11.37 CET AFP reports that Ukraine is now using its Leopard tanks in a defensive capacity, as its summer counter-offensive has ground to a halt. Kyiv lobbied for months this year to get the sophisticated Leopard tanks from Germany and other Western allies to push back Russian forces, but since Ukraine\u2019s offensive petered out this summer, the tanks have instead been deployed to hold the line. A deputy of a company in the 21st mechanised brigade told AFP the Strv 122 tank \u2013 the Swedish version of the Leopard 2A5 \u2013 was now being used to hit infantry groups or ammunition depots. \u201cIn other words, it\u2019s not being used in the same way as during the counter-offensive,\u201d said 25-year-old Ruslan, referring to Ukraine\u2019s push this summer to gain ground in the south. Kyiv had hoped the Leopards would penetrate Russian defences and then rumble south towards Crimea - the peninsula unilaterally annexed by the Kremlin in 2014. Instead, they are positioned along the front in the east, acting more like long-range artillery than offensive battle tanks moving deeper into Russian-held territories. Leopard-2 in Ukraine.
