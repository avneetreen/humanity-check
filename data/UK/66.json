Then you talk mobilisation, reservists or conscription.\n\"We have to realise it\u2019s not a given that we are in peace. And that\u2019s why we [Nato forces] are preparing for a conflict with Russia.\"\nGen Sir Patrick made his plea to ordinary Britons at the International Armoured Vehicles Conference in Twickenham.\nHe said: \"Our friends in Eastern and Northern Europe, who feel the proximity of the Russian threat more acutely, are already acting prudently, laying the foundations for national mobilisation.\n\"We will not be immune and as the pre-war generation we must similarly prepare - and that is a whole-of-nation undertaking.\n\"Ukraine brutally illustrates that regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them.\n\"Our predecessors failed to perceive the implications of the so-called July Crisis in 1914 and stumbled into the most ghastly of wars. We cannot afford to make the same mistake today.\"\nThe introduction of conscription were it to happen, would be the first time in over 60 years that Brits would be required to fight.\nMandatory military service was introduced during the First World War after the government passed the Military Service Act in 1916.\n6 Putin made a surprise to the Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University in the city of Kaliningrad in a chilling taunt to the West Credit: Reuters\n6 Military Committee Chief Rob Bauer said the West should be better prepared for a war with Russia Credit: Getty\n6 Chief of the General Staff, Sir Patrick Sanders, said Britain faces its \u201c1937 moment\u201d and must be prepared to act rapidly to prevent the spread of war Credit: PA", "source_domain": "www.thesun.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "UK reveals chilling likelihood Putin will launch ATTACK on Brit ally while Nato chief warns West 'must be ready' for WW3", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25514704/uk-putin-attack-brit-ally-nato-ww3/"}
