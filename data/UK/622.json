NATO countries, our sons and daughters, are at risk of being a part of a larger conflict,\" she said.\nBut Republicans remained skeptical, with Senator JD Vance, a close ally of former US president Donald Trump, dismissing the idea of Putin putting NATO countries in the region at risk \"preposterous.\"\nHe told CNN on Sunday that he opposes a \"blank check\" for Ukraine.\n\"You need to articulate what the ambition is. What is $61 billion going to accomplish that $100 billion hasn't?\" Vance said.\n\"What's in America's best interest is to accept Ukraine is going to have to cede some territory to the Russians and we need to bring the war to a close.\"\nThe funding row underscores signs that Western support for Ukraine is fraying just as Kyiv's counteroffensive falters and Putin's forces push for new gains.\nUkraine's offensive has employed billions of dollars' worth of Western weapons -- but the front lines have barely shifted in more than a year and Russian attacks along the front have intensified.\nThe White House said Biden's meeting will come at a vital moment, \"as Russia ramps up its missile and drone strikes against Ukraine.\"\nAt the start of December, Putin signed a decree to boost Russian forces by 15 percent, increasing the army by some 170,000 people.\nMoscow has recently given signs about a possible peace deal, although one involving a shrunken, neutral Ukraine that would be impossible to swallow for Zelensky.\nThe US State Department announced a stopgap $175 million tranche of new aid for Ukraine on Wednesday, including prized HIMARS rockets, shells, missiles and ammunition.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken insisted on Sunday that \"Ukraine has done an extraordinary job\" defending itself.\n\"The choice is very clear,\" he said on ABC. \"If we do this and help Ukraine sustain the achievements that it's made, help ensure that Russia continues to suffer a strategic failure in in Ukraine. That's one route to go.\n\"The other route to go is to do something that the only people who are rooting for it are in Moscow, and maybe in Tehran and Beijing, which is not to provide this assistance,\" he said.", "source_domain": "www.ibtimes.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Zelensky To Meet With Biden, Republicans As War Funding Dries Up", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/zelensky-meet-biden-republicans-war-funding-dries-1722100"}
