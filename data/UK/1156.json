Regrettably, the hospital is not functioning as a hospital anymore.\u201d\nHe also called for a ceasefire and said \u201cthe world cannot stand silent while hospitals, which should be safe havens, are transformed into scenes of death, devastation, and despair\u201d.\nIsrael\u2019s president Isaac Herzog said \u201ceverything is operating\u201d in Al-Shifa hospital and denied any Israeli strikes there.\nDoctors and the health ministry in Gaza said there is a shortage of fuel that has hindered surgeries and prevented the operation of incubators for premature babies. Mr Herzog, however, refuted the remarks.\n\u201cWe deny this at all, there is a lot of spin by Hamas... but there\u2019s electricity in Shifa, everything is operating,\u201d he said in an interview with the BBC.\nIsrael has alleged Hamas maintains a tunnel underneath the hospital building which acts as their base. The militant group has refuted these allegations.\nOn Sunday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Gaza\u2019s second-largest hospital, the al-Quds hospital, ceased operations due to a fuel shortage.\n\u201cThe hospital has been left to fend for itself under ongoing Israeli bombardment, posing severe risks to the medical staff, patients and displaced civilians,\u201d said the PRCS in a statement on Sunday, according to Al Jazeera.\n\u201cThis cessation of services is due to the depletion of available fuel and power outage. Medical staff are making every effort to provide care to patients and the wounded, even resorting to unconventional medical methods amid dire humanitarian conditions and a shortage of medical supplies, food, and water,\u201d PRCS said.\nThe WHO has joined other humanitarian organisations, including Doctors Without Borders, in demanding an end to assaults on healthcare facilities in Gaza and calling for an immediate ceasefire.\nSince the 7 October Hamas attack, Israel has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians, including 8,000 women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry.\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory said in its recent daily update that three of al-Shifa\u2019s nurses were killed.\n\u201cBombardments and armed clashes around the Shifa hospital in Gaza city intensified since the afternoon of 11 November,\u201d it said.\n\u201cCritical infrastructure, including the oxygen station, water tanks and a well, the cardiovascular facility, and the maternity ward, was damaged, and three nurses killed.\n\u201cAt Shifa, two premature babies and 10 other patients have died since the power outage that started on 11 November, compounded by the lack of medical consumables,\u201d it said.\nUNOCHA warned another 36 babies in incubators and kidney dialysis patients are at heightened risk of death.\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS News Hamas was using hospitals and other civilian facilities to house fighters and weapons, which he said was a violation of the laws of war.\n\u201cThe United States does not want to see firefights in hospitals where innocent people, patients receiving medical care, are caught in the crossfire and we\u2019ve had active consultations with the Israeli Defense Forces on this,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Hamas was \u201cdoing everything in its power\u201d to keep civilians \u201cin harm\u2019s way\u201d.\n\u201cWe have designated routes to a safe zone south of Gaza City. We want all civilians to be moved out of harm\u2019s way,\u201d he told CNN.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve called to evacuate all the patients from that (Al-Shifa) hospital, and 100 or so have already been evacuated. There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t just take the patients out of there.\u201d\nHe also told NBC News on Sunday that Israel had offered fuel to help operate the hospital.\n\u201cOn the contrary, we offered actually, last night, to give them enough fuel to operate the hospital, operate the incubators and so on, because we (have) no battle with patients or civilians at all,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are expecting to lose more of them [premature babies] day by day,\u201d Dr Ahmed El Mokhallalati was quoted as saying by Reuters.\nAl Jazeera reported that northern Gaza\u2019s Kamal Adwan Hospital was also forced to shut operations due to a lack of fuel for its main generator.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Gaza\u2019s largest hospital \u2018no longer functioning\u2019, says WHO", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/al-shifa-hospital-gaza-who-israel-latest-b2446182.html"}
