His memo came out the same day it was announced Austin was being treated for prostate cancer.\n'Notify the Offices of Cabinet Affairs and White House Chief of Staff in the event of a delegation of authority or potential delegation,' Zients wrote in the memo, which was obtained by The New York Times. 'This notification should occur when agencies anticipate or are preparing for a delegation of authority and again when the delegation occurs.'\nThe Pengaton said on Tuesday it is correcting its procedures.\n'The department is taking immediate steps to correct our notification procedures,' Pentagon press secretary Major General Patrick Ryder said at his briefing.\n'We want to make sure that notifications are happening in a timely way. And this way, as we've acknowledged, there were some shortfalls and so it's important that we go back and look at what those shortfalls work. What could have been done better and make sure that going forward. We're improving those processes,' he said.\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin was last seen in public on December 20th (above) and the fallout from his secret hospitalization continues\nWhite House Chief of Staff Jeffrey Zients sent a memo to Cabinet officials demanding the White House be told if there are major medical or other issues\nZients also directed Cabinet officials to ensure power is transferred 'when a cabinet member is traveling to areas with limited or no access to communication, undergoing hospitalization or a medical procedure requiring general anesthesia, or otherwise in a circumstance when he or she may be unreachable.'\nThe memo was sent out as President Joe Biden and his team continue to deal with the political headache left to them after Austin failed to inform them of his hospitalization until four days after it occurred.\nSenior administration and defense officials were not told for days about his hospitalization or his cancer.\nThe Pentagon confirmed on Tuesday that Austin had prostate cancer.\n'On Dec 22 after consultation with his medical team, he was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and underwent a minimally invasive surgical procedure called a prostatectomy to treat and cure prostate cancer,' the hospital said in a statement.\nHis cancer was 'diagnosed early and his prognosis is excellent.'\nHis complications included 'nausea with severe abdominal, leg and hip pain.' The early diagnosis was a urinary tract infection but further examination showed Austin, 70, had a fluid build up in his abdomen that was impairing the function of his small intestines.\nThe infection was treated by a tube placed through is nose that went down to his stomach. The infection has cleared, the Pentagon said, and Austin 'continues to make progress.' He 'never lost consciousness and never underwent general anesthesia.'\n'The department is taking immediate steps to correct our notification procedures,' Pentagon press secretary Major General Patrick Ryder said Tuesday\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin could have broken the law by failing to report his absence - he is seen above participating in the Virtual Red Sea Security Summit at NAVCENT headquarters in Manama, Bahrain, on December 19\nTimeline on Lloyd Austin's illness Dec. 22: Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has procedure at Walter Reed Dec. 23: Austin returns home Dec. 27: President Biden leaves for St. Croix for New Year's vacation Jan. 1: Austin participates in national security phone call Jan. 1: Austin admitted to ICU Jan. 2: Austin top staffers informed of his hospitalization Jan. 2: Biden returns to White House Jan. 2: Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks takes some of Austin's duties Jan. 4: Biden and Hicks told Austin is in hospital Jan. 5: Congress informed Jan. 6: Biden and Austin speak via phone Jan. 9: Pentagon announces Austin was being treated for prostate cancer Advertisement\nAustin could have broken the law by failing to report his absence, the Pentagon has launched a full investigation into the matter and one Republican lawmaker filed articles of impeachment against the defense secretary.\nAustin, 70, remains at Walter Reed Medical Center but is out of the ICU and has retaken control of his authorities as the head of U.S. armed forces. The White House has said President Biden backs him but lawmakers in both parties are questioning the Pentagon's handling of the situation. The White House also had said they would be conducting a review of the situation.\nThe Pentagon said Monday night that it's still unclear when Austin will be released from the hospital but vowed to give daily updates until he is out.\nPentagon press secretary Major General Patrick Ryder said in a statement on Monday that Austin 'continues to experience discomfort but his prognosis is good.' Ryder said that Austin is in 'good condition' and that he is 'recovering well and in good spirits.'\nAs part of the fallout, Kelly Magsamen, Austin's chief of staff, ordered a 30-day investigation into the events surrounding Austin's hospitalization, the Pentagon announced late Monday night.\nBut the matter was not referred to the Defense Department inspector general's office for an independent review. It will be led by Jennifer Walsh, the Pentagon's director of administration and management.\nMagsamen had been ill with the flu and was unaware that Austin had been hospitalized. Officials have cited her illness as one of the reasons the White House wasn't informed about the secretary's condition.\nAustin's top staffers knew about his hospitalization on Jan. 2, the day after it occurred, however. Biden wasn't told until Jan. 4.\nThe review will establish a timeline of events beginning Jan. 1 when Austin was taken by ambulance to Walter Reed and examine how decisions were made about informing officials of his condition.\n'This review will help to ensure clarity and transparency when a determination has been made that certain authorities have been transferred,' Magsamen wrote. 'And that proper and timely notification has been made to the President and White House and, as appropriate, the United States Congress and the American public.'\nKelly Magsamen (left), Lloyd Austin's chief of staff, ordered a 30-day investigation into the events surrounding the defense secretary's hospitalization; Pentagon press secretary Major General Patrick Ryder (right) was one of the top officials who knew of Austin's hospitalization\nThe White House announced President Biden backs Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin (seen above with Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas at the White House on August 30th)\nEarlier Monday, Ryder acknowledged that he knew of Austin's hospitalization on Jan. 2 and should have pushed to inform the public sooner.\nIn an hour-long back-and-forth with reporters, which was held off-camera, Ryder offered no explanation as to why the White House wasn't informed sooner.\nAsked if Austin directed any of his staff to withhold information, he answered indirectly, saying: 'That is one of the things we'll be looking at in terms of process improvements.'\nLegal experts told Reuters that Austin may have violated a U.S. law on 'reporting of vacancies' that requires the head of executive agencies to 'submit to the Comptroller General of the United States and to each House of Congress' any vacancies and the name of the person filling the vacancy.\nThe Marine Corps announced late Monday that its commandant, Gen. Eric Smith, underwent successful open heart surgery\nThe Comptroller General would then relay that information to the president and the Office of Personnel Management.\nThe law is largely procedural and does not spell out any penalties for lapses. Austin would likely face only a reprimand from Biden.\nMeanwhile, the Marine Corps announced late Monday that its commandant, Gen. Eric Smith, underwent successful open heart surgery Monday.\nThe Marine Corps said the surgery repaired a bicuspid aortic valve in Smith's heart, which caused his cardiac arrest on Oct. 28. The Marine Corps, back in October, had announced Smith's heart attack within 24 hours of it occurring.\n'He is in good condition and recovering at the hospital with his family,' they said.\nThe prompt public disclosure and details of the surgery were in stark contrast to how officials handled Austin's surgery.\nThe Marine Corps handling of General Smith's surgery has resulted in comparisons to the Pentagon's handling of Secretary Austin's surgery\nThe Pentagon continues to refuse to say what procedure Austin had or describe the complications he suffered.\nIt's unclear if even the president knows but the White House made it clear that Biden backs Austin.\n'There are no plans for anything other than for Secretary Austin to stay in the job and continue in the leadership that he's been demonstrating,' White House spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday.\n'Our main focus right now is on Secretary Austin's health and making sure that he gets all the care and the support that he needs to fully recovered,' he said.\nNeither Kirby nor White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre would say if Biden knows what medical condition his defense secretary is suffering from. Biden and Austin spoke on Saturday.\n'I don't know the level of the president's personal knowledge of his (Austin's) medical situation. That would really be between the two men,' Kirby said.\n'That it is not something that we can speak to right. This is his own medical - it is it is a private thing \u2013 this is something that the Secretary and the Department of Defense would speak to,' Jean-Pierre said.\nKirby pledged the White House would investigate the matter, looking at the 'process and procedure' regarding the location and health of senior officials after Biden was not told for four days that his defense secretary was in the hospital.\nHe said the administration would perform a 'hot wash,' which is a military term to describe an intense, quick review.\n'As you might expect, we'll take a look at process and procedure here. And try to learn from this experience and if there's some changes that need to be made, in terms of process and procedure, we'll do that,' Kirby said.\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin was last seen in public on December 20th (above) on the USS Gerald R Ford\nMontana Rep. Matt Rosendale announced Monday night that he is filing articles of impeachment against Defense Secretary Austin\nRepublicans have seized on the issue and Montana Rep. Matt Rosendale announced Monday night that he is filing articles of impeachment against Austin.\nRosendale says Austin has 'violated his office' multiple times, giving the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal and the Chinese spy balloon debacle as examples.\n'Sec. Austin knowingly put the American people in danger and compromised our national security when he allowed a spy balloon from a foreign adversary to fly over Malmstrom Air Force Base \u2013 home to ICBMs \u2013 and allowed the Chinese Communist Party to gather intel on American citizens,' he said in a statement.\n'This dishonesty seems to be a repeated pattern for the Secretary as he once again lied to our military and the American people about his health last week.\n'Sec. Austin is unfit for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, which is why I urge my colleagues to join me in impeaching him to protect the American people,' he added.\nRosendale is mulling a Senate run in Montana, even as GOP leaders have already thrown their weight behind another Republican in the race, Tim Sheehy.\nDemocrats, too, have expressed concern.\nSen. Jack Reed, the Democrat from Rhode Island who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, made his first public remarks about the situation on Monday. He spoke to Austin on Sunday.\nHe said he wishes Austin a 'speedy and complete recovery' but has concerns 'that vital chain of command and notification procedures were not followed while the Secretary was under medical care.'\nWhile Austin is taking responsibility for the secrecy, 'this was a serious incident and there needs to be transparency and accountability from the Department,' said Reed. This lack of disclosure must never happen again.'", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "White House orders Cabinet secretaries to tell them when they can't perform their duties as fallout continues from Austin's secret hospitalization", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12944087/White-House-fallout-austin-surgery-cabinet-orders.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490"}
