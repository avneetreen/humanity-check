This has not stopped Israel\u2019s air force bombing in the south, but by contrast the north has been smashed.\nOn Wednesday, Yahya al-Sarraj, the mayor of Gaza City, told Al Jazeera that 60% of housing units and apartments have been destroyed, roughly in line with analysis from satellite imagery. By contrast, in Khan Younis, the estimate is that 10% to 15% of buildings have been damaged.\nAn idea that is being aired in some circles, though not publicly, is that Israel\u2019s military will have to organise local evacuations of civilians on a village-by-village or district-by-district basis, before attacking to take control of both the ground and tunnels below. Air power may only be deployed once an evacuation is complete.\nIt would also mean drawn-out fighting \u2013 \u201cthe overarching strategy is for a very long war,\u201d Hayman says grimly. Gaza\u2019s northernmost town, Beit Hanoun, was after the initial aerial bombardment attacked and surrounded, and a commander, Col Arye Baat from the 252nd division, a unit of reservists, said it took \u201cabout 24 days\u201d to seize military control in heavy fighting.\nIf the new model is viable, the IDF thinks fighting will could go on for months, at least into January. But the prospect of a longer war and above all further evacuations, to an increasingly small portion of the strip, alarms aid agencies and will raise wider concerns that Israel\u2019s ultimate goal is to depopulate the strip.\n\u201cI would call that a Nakba,\u201d said one aid official who asked not to be named, a reference to the mass displacement of Palestinians in the 1948 war.\nIn any event, the humanitarian situation in the south is challenging enough. Oxfam says it and its partners have struggled to deliver aid on the levels required during the current pause in fighting, with water, electricity and full telecoms not restored, with humanitarian workers and machinery to remove the rubble often denied entry.\nBushra Khalidi, Oxfam\u2019s policy lead for Gaza, said the six-day pause \u201chas failed\u201d as an effective mechanism for enhanced aid delivery. \u201cOne of our main concerns remains the establishment and management of safe zones or humanitarian areas, which have proven to be highly problematic,\u201d she added.\nThe concerns are not lost on Israel\u2019s principal supporter, the US. \u201cWe don\u2019t support southern operations unless or until the Israelis can show that they have accounted for all the internally displaced people of Gaza,\u201d John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson said on Tuesday, a message that he added the Israelis \u201cwere receptive to\u201d.\nEarly in the seven-week war, Israel announced the establishment of a humanitarian zone in al-Mawasi, a parcel of land on the Mediterranean coast 0.6 miles (1km) wide and 8.7 miles (14km) long, but earlier this month the idea was condemned by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization.\n\u201cAttempting to cram so many people into such a small area with such little infrastructure or services will significantly increase risks to health for people who are already on the brink,\u201d he told the UN, and said his body would not participate in setting up such a zone unless safety and security conditions were met.\nIsrael\u2019s leaders and generals, however, keep repeating they are determined to defeat Hamas militarily. A fresh IDF estimate suggests half \u2013 seven out of 14 \u2013 Hamas battalions remain combat-effective in northern Gaza after nearly a month of pre-truce ground operations, and there are a further 10 in the south.\nThe stakes have been raised so high by Israel, which argues that the very existence of Hamas on its border amounts to an existential threat, that the simple survival of the group as a coherent force and Sinwar himself would be seen as a defeat. But with diminishing amounts of land left, it is far from clear how Israel can attack in the south without the most dire consequences for 2 million or more people.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Next phase of Gaza war risks unprecedented humanitarian crisis", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/29/next-phase-of-gaza-war-risks-unprecedented-humanitarian-crisis"}
