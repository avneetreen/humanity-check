Sevastopol in illegally Russian-held Crimea was targeted, along with the Bryansk, Kaluga and Tula regions, according to Russian officials, who as usual claimed all drones were intercepted and/or destroyed.\nThe US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned on Monday that Ukraine\u2019s gains over two years of fighting were in doubt without new US funding , as Nato\u2019s chief visited to lobby Congress.\nThe European parliament is investigating claims that one of its members has spied for Russia\u2019s FSB since at least 2004. Tatjana \u017ddanoka, a Latvian MEP, has denied allegations published by the Insider, a Russian investigative newspaper, which put together the story along with Estonia\u2019s Delfi, Latvia\u2019s Re:Baltica and Sweden\u2019s Expressen.\nInsider alleged emails between \u017ddanoka and Russian case officers included reports on her work as a European legislator including fostering pro-Kremlin sentiment.

In a video on Facebook, \u017ddanoka said: \u201cI have never been associated with the KGB \u2026 and I have not cooperated with any other intelligence agencies.\u201d\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry said on Monday that its forces had taken control of the village of Tabaivka in Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region, but Ukraine denied this. Volodymyr Fityo, the head of communications for Ukraine\u2019s ground forces, said: \u201cThis does not correspond to reality.

The release of the footage by the defence ministry follows drone strikes launched from Ukraine on Russian cities and energy infrastructure while Moscow presses on with its military campaign against Kyiv. Shoigu was shown inspecting defence industry facilities in the Urals industrial city of Ekaterinburg and touring factories producing sea- and ground-launched cruise missiles and air defence systems. \u201cThere has been a significant increase in the volume of production. We have more than doubled production of the missiles we need for air defence,\u201d he said at one factory. \u201cBut there are some key issues we need to address. And we need to address them quite vigorously. There is the question of engines, and there is the question of the establishment of launcher production.\u201d The defence ministry published the videos on its Telegram messenger channel. Russian officials have in recent months flagged rapid improvements in the country\u2019s military industrial capacity, aimed at bolstering Russia\u2019s military in its deadlocked campaign against Ukraine. Over the recent weeks, attacks, some of which have been claimed by Ukrainian officials or blamed on Kyiv by the Kremlin, have hit Russian cities and oil and gas facilities.\nUpdated at 16.55 CET\n6d ago 15.39 CET Russia showing no willingness to return PoW bodies, Ukrainian intelligence official says A Ukrainian military spy official said on Tuesday that Russia was showing no willingness to return the bodies of dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war Moscow says died in a military plane crash in Belgorod region last week, Reuters reports. Kyiv has said Moscow has provided no evidence to support its assertion that 65 captured Ukrainian soldiers were onboard the Russian military transport plane, which crashed last Wednesday in Belgorod in Russia near the border. Moscow says the plane was shot down by Ukraine on its way to a prisoner swap; Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied that its forces shot it down. \u201cIt\u2019s a statement from Russia that our prisoners were there, and so far we can analyse only their words. Now there is no readiness to transfer the bodies from the other side,\u201d Andriy Yusov, the spokesperson, was quoted as saying by Suspilne broadcaster. Russia\u2019s state Investigative Committee said last week that body parts were being collected and removed for genetic testing. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday he had no information on what would happen to the remains or whether they would be handed to Ukraine. The Russian Investigative Committee has released footage from the site showing a single body in a snowy field as well as items of clothing. Reuters verified the location of the crash site seen in one of the videos but was unable to independently verify the date or other details. Ukraine\u2019s human rights commissioner Dmytro Lubinets told Reuters last week that an unofficial list of Ukrainian PoW casualties circulated in Russian media after the crash included soldiers who had already returned in a previous swap.\nUpdated at 16.04 CET\n6d ago 15.37 CET Volodymyr Zelenskiy reiterates calls for 'air shield' to protect Ukraine from missile and drone attacks Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has reiterated calls for an \u201cair shield\u201d to protect the country from missiles and drone attacks.

The incident is the latest in a spate of suspicious fires and derailments on Russia\u2019s rail network that Moscow has blamed on Kyiv and its supporters, AFP reports. \u201cTwo suspects were identified and detained at their homes in the town of Dolgoprudny near Moscow. They turned out to be 17-year-old teenagers,\u201d police told the TASS news agency. According to investigators, a supporter of Ukraine contacted one of the teenagers online and persuaded him to carry out the attack in return for cash. The suspect then asked his friend to help and they both travelled to Mark station in the suburbs of northern Moscow, where they set fire to the cabinet. The pair have been remanded in custody on sabotage charges, which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, depending on the severity of the crime.\n6d ago 14.37 CET The Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov held a meeting with the Chinese deputy foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu on Tuesday to discuss the conflict in Ukraine, the situation in the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East and the Korean peninsula, his ministry said in a statement, without immediately releasing further details.\n6d ago 14.17 CET European Union nations have decided to approve an outline deal that would keep in reserve the profits from hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian central bank assets that have been frozen in retaliation for Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine, an EU official told the Associated Press. The tentative agreement, reached late Monday, still needs formal approval but is seen as a first step toward using some of the \u20ac200bn (\u00a3171bn/$216bn) in Russian central bank assets in the EU to help Ukraine rebuild from Russian destruction. The official, who asked not to be identified since the agreement was not yet legally ratified, said the bloc \u201cwould allow to start collecting the extraordinary revenues generated from the frozen assets ... to support the reconstruction of Ukraine.\u201d How the proceeds will be used will be decided later, as the issue remains mired in legal and practical considerations. There is urgency since Ukraine is struggling to make ends meet, and aid plans in the EU and the United States are being held back over political considerations including whether allies will continue helping Ukraine at the same pace as they did in the first two years of the war. EU leaders will meet on Thursday hoping to approve a \u20ac50bn ($54bn) support package for Ukraine over the solitary opposition of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\nUpdated at 15.55 CET\n6d ago 13.59 CET Summary of the day so far...

Russia and Japan have never signed a peace treaty formally ending the conflict between them that dates back to the second world war, with the Kuril Islands \u2013 which Japan calls the Northern Territories \u2013 remaining the primary stumbling block between the two sides. TASS cited Medvedev as saying that Russia was not against signing a peace treaty with Japan, but only if Tokyo no longer disputed the islands' status.\n6d ago 10.28 CET Reuters reports that Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza has been transferred to a new penal colony in the Omsk region of Siberia and placed in a punishment block, Novaya Gazeta Europe reported on Tuesday, citing his lawyer.
