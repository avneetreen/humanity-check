The agency's update cited Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, as saying that Kyiv had no verifiable information about who was on the plane.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that missiles fired from across the border brought down the transport plane that it said was taking the POWs back to Ukraine. Local authorities in Belgorod, which borders Ukraine, said the crash killed all 74 people onboard, including six crew members and three Russian servicemen.\n\u201cWe currently don\u2019t have evidence that there could have been that many people onboard the aircraft. Russian propaganda\u2019s claim that the IL-76 aircraft was transporting 65 Ukrainian POWs (heading) for a prisoner swap continues to raise a lot of questions,\u201d Budanov, who heads Ukraine's POW agency, said.\nSocial media users in the Belgorod region posted a video Wednesday that showed a plane falling from the sky in a snowy, rural area, and a huge ball of fire erupting where it apparently hit the ground.\nKyiv has neither confirmed nor denied that its forces downed a Russian military transport plane that day, and Russia's claim that the crash killed Ukrainian POWs could not be independently verified. Earlier Friday, Mykola Oleshchuk, Ukraine\u2019s air force commander, described Moscow\u2019s assertion as \u201crampant Russian propaganda.\u201d\nUkrainian officials earlier this week confirmed that a prisoner swap was due to happen Wednesday but said it was called off. They said Moscow did not ask for any specific stretch of airspace to be kept safe for a certain length of time, as it has for past prisoner exchanges.\nAn International Committee of the Red Cross spokesperson in Ukraine urged Russia on Friday night to return the bodies of any POWs who might have died in the plane crash.\nIn a live interview with the U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Red Cross Media Relations Officer Oleksandr Vlasenko also remarked that \u201cvery little time\u201d had passed between the initial reports of the incident and Moscow declaring it was ready to return the bodies of the Ukrainian POWs.\nWhile Ukraine and Russia regularly exchange the bodies of dead soldiers, each trade has required considerable preparation, Vlasenko said.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for an international investigation into the crash. Russia has sole access to the crash site.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin pledged Friday to make the findings of Moscow\u2019s crash investigation public. In his first public remarks on the incident, Putin repeated previous comments by Russian officials that \u201ceverything was planned\u201d for a prisoner exchange that day when the aircraft went down.\n\u201cKnowing (the POWs were aboard), they attacked this plane. I don\u2019t know whether they did it on purpose or by mistake, through thoughtlessness,\u201d Putin said of Ukraine at a meeting with students in St. Petersburg.\nHe offered no details to support the allegation that Kyiv was to blame, but said the plane\u2019s flight recorders had been found.\n\u201cThere are black boxes, everything will now be collected and shown,\u201d Putin said.\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Ukraine says there's no evidence for Russia's claim that dozens of POWs died in a plane crash", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ukraine-ap-russia-moscow-kyiv-b2485897.html"}
