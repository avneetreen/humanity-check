For years, the school psychologist has been active in Muslim-Jewish interfaith dialogue, but the Israel-Hamas war left her reeling.\n\u201cWhat are we doing with talking to each other?\u201d she recalled thinking, frustrated by a conversation about the exact number of Palestinians killed in an Israeli airstrike. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nBut she decided to fight that thought and tackle the hard discussions once again. Later, Quaizar, who is Muslim, met with women like Aviva Seltzer, the daughter of a rabbi and a Jewish school principal who was raised with the belief that \u201cbut for the existence of Israel, we\u2019d all be dead.\u201d\nThe two had come together for a conference in New Brunswick, New Jersey, convened by the Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom, an organization seeking to build trust and friendships between Muslim and Jewish women.\nThese conversations are becoming increasingly difficult, with the war and its polarizing reverberations in America testing and straining some interfaith relationships more than ever. For many, the losses are too personal, the emotions too raw.\nThe latest violence, triggered by the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, is prompting some to question the point of these conversations \u2014 and how to have them \u2014 while steeling the resolve of others to keep going.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very courageous, you and I, because we don\u2019t stop talking,\u201d Seltzer told Quaizar. \u201cThe minute we stop talking, there\u2019s no hope.\u201d\nQuaizar nodded and said, \u201cWe\u2019re doing the hardest work right now.\u201d\nAt the event, Sisterhood co-founder Atiya Aftab, a Muslim, told participants that simply showing up was an achievement. Next to her, Roberta Elliott, who\u2019s Jewish and the nonprofit\u2019s president, said she couldn\u2019t have gotten through the previous weeks \u201cwithout my Muslim sisters.\u201d\nThey\u2019ve seen the challenges mount.\nThere are \u201call these barriers now to come to the table,\u201d Aftab said in an interview.\nShe\u2019s questioned why she\u2019s not walking away herself.\n\u201cSometimes it seems insurmountable to have conversations with people who have a diametrically different viewpoint,\u201d Aftab said. \u201cFaith is what keeps me there \u2014 and hope.\u201d\nPart of the difficulty of discussing the war was underscored in responses to the organization's public call earlier for a cease-fire. Elliott said some Jewish women would have preferred the group advocated for a humanitarian pause instead.\nMore recently, heated debates also erupted over what to call Israel\u2019s military action. Tensions flared on members\u2019 WhatsApp groups.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to remind people that they need to step back, that they need to take deep breaths,\" Elliott said. Still, she said, \u201cthis is what we\u2019ve been preparing for ... to try to be a comfort for each other and try to achieve something together.\u201d\nBut in the Israeli-Palestinian context, some critics say many interfaith efforts fall short. Detractors argue that focusing on Muslim-Jewish relationships also risks inadvertently reducing the conflict to religion, ignoring all factors at play or overlooking the diversity of communities, including non-Muslim Palestinians and Jewish supporters of the Palestinian cause.\nAftab said wading into areas of disagreement, especially after establishing trust, is necessary for meaningful interactions.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a religious conflict, but this conflict is sometimes clothed in religion,\u201d she said. \u201cI think our faith groups can inspire us to do the right thing, to remedy the wrongs, to stand up for justice, to stand up for life.\u201d\nAndrea Hodos, associate director of Los Angeles-based NewGround, another Muslim-Jewish partnership, said religion is \u201cnot the entire puzzle,\u201d but is a piece of it and that helping people understand these things is important.\nSome, she said, are saying, \"'How can you just talk right now? People are dying.\u2019\u201d But \u201cif we\u2019re not doing our work to help people see one another, we\u2019re all going to remain in our silos and it actually makes it more dangerous.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hard for some that the group isn\u2019t taking certain positions, Hodos, who is Jewish, said, adding that political action isn\u2019t its role.\n\u201cWe try to get people who have differences of opinion to be able to hear one another.\" That way, when they are doing advocacy, they can consider more perspectives and have compassion for their side and the other, she said.\nThe Kaufman Interfaith Institute held a meeting that highlighted the challenges ahead, said Fred Stella, who is a member of the organization\u2019s advisory board.\n\u201cPeople were looking for statements from us,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is, how do you respond to something like this without either offending one of the sides or simply mouthing virtually meaningless platitudes?\u201d\nHis group has mostly focused on fighting antisemitic and anti-Muslim hate, which has risen during the war. \u201cThe only thing I think we in the interfaith community can do \u2026 is to continue to remind people of our shared humanity.\u201d\nInterfaith advocates say they\u2019ve also seen bonds \u2014 old and new \u2014 nurtured.\n\u201cEven when people are in deep disagreement, there\u2019s a great deal of goodwill and attempts to reach out,\u201d Hodos said. \u201cNot everyone can do it. Some of the groups have just been ... very quiet and I think people have, for now, walked away from the table.\u201d\nOthers are newcomers. In Teaneck, New Jersey, two high school students and friends \u2014 Rawda Elbatrawish, who is Muslim, and Liora Pelavin, who is Jewish \u2014 said they organized events for conversations and education on the conflict.\nThey wanted attendees to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. \u201cThe whole point ... was to really understand the other perspective and why someone believes what they do,\" said Elbatrawish, who was born in Egypt.\nPelavin \u2014 who has relatives in the Israel Defense Forces and a rabbi mom who's been involved with human rights organizations \u2014 said some participants lauded the importance of interfaith events and the deeper connections of in-person conversations.\nShe and Elbatrawish \"come from different perspectives,\u201d she said, but both want a cease-fire.\nAt the Sisterhood conference, Quaizar said communicating with Jewish members has helped her through her anger. It\u2019s OK, she said \u201cfor me to grieve for my people as well as for people on the Jewish side.\u201d\nBut she recalled struggling at one point before the conference with staying in such dialogue. She then attended a Sisterhood chapter meeting, feeling in turmoil. Everyone cried, she said. That gave her hope. \u201cThey were not crying for Jews or Muslims or Israelis or Palestinians; they were crying for people who have been suffering.\u201d\nOn the conference sidelines, Quaizar told Seltzer: \u201cI have a very unfiltered way of talking\u201d but don\u2019t mean to cause hurt.\nSeltzer reassured her: \u201cYou speak unfiltered, so that\u2019s how we get to the core.\u201d\nSeltzer found the event eye-opening.\n\u201cA number of the speakers said you can hold two feelings in your heart at the same time,\u201d she said. \u201cI never knew I could do that.\u201d\nContinuing to talk, she said, was crucial.\n\u201cYou want peace; you want your family; you want your home; you want your kids to grow up happy, just like me.\u201d\nAt the end of the day, the two women tightly embraced.\n\u201cPeople are angry and people are in pain and it goes around and around. ... We have to find a way to stop,\u201d Seltzer said. \u201cOr there will not be anything left for our children.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.
