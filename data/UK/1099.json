Photo by Jacquelyn / AFP via Getty Images\nOn 8 November at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Tokyo, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken addressed the future of the Gaza Strip after Israel\u2019s war against Hamas has ended. \u201cGaza cannot\u2026 continue to be run by Hamas; that simply invites a repetition of 7 October,\u201d he told his foreign counterparts. But, he added, \u201cit\u2019s also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza\u201d.\nYet only the day before, Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had told ABC News that his country \u201cwould have overall security responsibility [in Gaza] for an indefinite period\u201d should Hamas be vanquished \u2013 an apparent and public clash with the US\u2019s stated position.\nThis is a sign that, despite the US\u2019s staunch support of Israel\u2019s war effort, it is diplomatically, yet publicly, pushing Israel to be clear about its postwar intentions and to minimise civilian casualties. According to Alon Pinkas, Israel\u2019s former consul general in New York, \u201cwe don\u2019t see\u201d the significant pressure the US is placing on Israel. It is in private conversations where Washington\u2019s influence is most keenly felt.\nThe US has focused on three key issues in its blunt closed-door talks with Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet. The first is to warn Israel against escalating the conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon \u2013 a wider war is what the US fears the most. The second is over what Israel\u2019s plan is for the Strip \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 if Hamas is defeated. The third is over minimising civilian harm.\nMore than 11,000 Palestinians, including 4,000 children, have been killed in Israel\u2019s war on Hamas, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The war has destroyed Gaza\u2019s infrastructure and created a refugee crisis. On 13 November the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, which delivers aid across the Strip, said that its fuel depot was empty. This meant that within days there would be no electricity to power hospitals or even sewage pumps.\nSubscribe to the Saturday Read View all newsletters Your new guide to the best writing on ideas, politics, books and culture each weekend \u2013 from the New Statesman.

THANK YOU Close\nIsrael has said that this war will take time and, six weeks into the conflict, its army is deep inside Gaza. Yet Hamas fighters operate in an intricate network of tunnels underground. Israeli journalists embedded within the Israel Defense Forces have reported seeing few militants above ground, only terrified civilians. Netanyahu insists that they are removing Hamas\u2019s military capabilities \u201cstep by step\u201d.\n[See also: The Iran Trap]\nYet, across the West, patience among Israel\u2019s international backers is running out, as people take to the streets to call for a ceasefire. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who visited Israel in solidarity in the aftermath of Hamas\u2019s attack, recently urged the country to stop killing Gazan women and babies \u2013 though he later scrambled to reassure counterparts in Israel of French support. The UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said the sheer scale of civilian death shows \u201csomething is wrong\u201d with Israel\u2019s military tactics.\nPolling from Brookings shows that support for Israel among the American public has fallen, particularly among Democrats. The Biden administration, facing domestic pressure ahead of the 2024 election, may fear that the political cost of continuing to support Israel might become too high. The divergence in interests between the US and Israeli governments is still mostly hidden, for now. Yet this divide could be critical for Israel, which heavily relies on US support. \u201cWe aren\u2019t there yet,\u201d says Pinkas, \u201cbut we are close.\u201d\nThe Netanyahu government is also under intense internal pressure. Before 7 October, Israel was a country riven by protest, most recently over the government\u2019s anti-democratic attempt to curb the judiciary\u2019s powers. Now, thousands of families are displaced from the south and the north, where Hezbollah has been firing over the border. And Hamas continues to fire rockets across the country. In the West Bank, armed settler extremists have been harassing and killing Palestinian herders, with few reprisals from security forces.\nSurveys indicate that most Israeli Jews support the war, with only 10 per cent believing Israel should stop the fighting to exchange the more than 200 hostages still held by Hamas \u2013 despite protests from the families of the kidnapped. The Israeli taboo over criticising the state during war is veering into outright censorship, with reports of Palestinian and Arab citizens of Israel being arrested for alleged incitement over social media posts. Mohammad Darawshe is a long-time peace advocate whose 23-year-old cousin was murdered at the Nova Festival. He said he feels silenced by Netanyahu\u2019s government, and Israelis in general: \u201cWe shut our mouths, swallow our hearts and our tongues, and cry quietly about what we are seeing in Gaza.\u201d\nIsrael may insist that the war will take time, but Pinkas told me that the US \u201chas called Israel\u2019s bluff\u201d, with the fighting dragging on because Israel doesn\u2019t have a postwar plan. Then there are Netanyahu\u2019s motivations. Eager to avoid facing his ongoing criminal corruption case, eager to avoid the reckoning of a postwar public inquiry, he may have his own reasons for wanting the conflict to continue.\nOn 13 November the foreign minister Eli Cohen predicted that there were two or three weeks before international support for Israel recedes. Israel needs the US for its survival, but it also needs regional support from the Arab states for a viable future. There will be a day after this war. If Israel wants to guarantee its security in the long term, it can only do so by trying to find a political solution that gives the Palestinians freedom and statehood. So far, no military solution has sufficed.\n[See also: Rashid Khalidi: \u201cIsrael is stealing land as we speak\u201d]\nRelated", "source_domain": "www.newstatesman.com", "text": null, "title": "In public the US supports Israel, but in private pressure mounts", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.newstatesman.com/world/middle-east/2023/11/united-states-israel-support-postwar-gaza"}
