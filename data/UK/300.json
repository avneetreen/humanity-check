His government quickly introduced legislation to overhaul the judicial system, which supporters say is needed to better balance the branches of government. Critics say the changes amount to democratic backsliding.\nThe proposals exposed deep political rifts in Israeli society and led to the biggest protest movement the country has ever seen. The overhaul was frozen after the 7 October attacks by Hamas, but a supreme court decision on the one part of the law that had been passed was due by 12 January.\nWhat just happened?\nIn July last year, after huge protests and wildcat strikes against the judicial overhaul, the government managed to pass the first plank of the legislation \u2013 a law scrapping the \u201creasonableness\u201d clause that allows the supreme court to overrule government decisions.\nAfter months of deliberations, the bench ruled on Monday by a slim majority of eight to seven to throw out the law curtailing its own powers, saying it would severely damage Israel\u2019s democracy.\nThis is the first time Israel\u2019s supreme court has overturned a quasi-constitutional \u201cbasic law\u201d, and several government ministers had previously indicated they would not comply with a ruling striking the law down.\nThe most significant part of the decision is that 12 of the justices on the bench of 15 agreed for the first time that the supreme court does in principle have the right to overturn basic laws.\nOne of Netanyahu\u2019s allies attempted to introduce a last-minute bill that would postpone publication of the decision. Instead, after a draft was leaked to Israeli media, the court published the ruling early.\nWhat happens next?\nIt is possible that the decision could reignite the tensions that roiled Israel before the Hamas attack and further destabilise Netanyahu\u2019s already shaky wartime unity government.\nThe court ruling \u2013 and its timing \u2013 were quickly criticised by government officials, including the architect of the legislation, the justice minister, Yariv Levin. Some rightwing ministers and members of the Knesset have already vowed to push ahead with the judicial overhaul: Levin, or a future rightwing government, could try to reintroduce the legislation in future, aided by a change in the makeup of the supreme court, which is set to have a conservative majority soon.\nIsraeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, however, quoted an unnamed senior coalition official as saying: \u201cThe reform died on 7 October and won\u2019t come back to life.\u201d\nWill this affect the war in Gaza?\nBefore the events of 7 October, large-scale protests by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reservists over the judicial overhaul led to worries about the army\u2019s operational readiness; Hamas, Iran and Israel\u2019s other enemies closely followed what they saw as internal weakness.\nAn hour after the court announced its decision, IDF spokesperson Brig Gen Daniel Hagari hinted that the supreme court decision was welcome. The public discord in Israel last year probably influenced Hamas\u2019s decision to attack, he said, but the IDF was now \u201cfighting with full unity in its ranks \u2026 expressing the strength of Israeli society.\u201d\nThere were particular concerns in the military that the proposals for the judiciary could expose officers to international prosecution for war crimes. Israel is not a member of the international criminal court, arguing that its own legal system adequately investigates accusations of wrongdoing by the armed forces.\nPalestinians and rights groups have long said that the very low number of indictments in Israeli investigations suggests current practice is not fit for purpose.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel\u2019s judicial overhaul plans: what is row about and will it affect war in Gaza?", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/02/israels-judicial-overhaul-plans-what-is-row-about-and-will-it-affect-war-in-gaza"}
