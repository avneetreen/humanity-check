Intent is critical to a court decision on genocide, so it would require the ICJ judges in some way to look past the statements of Netanyahu to other statements by ministers, and the actions of the Israeli Defense Forces, if it was to rule there is a threat of genocide that needs preventing.\nAn immediate ceasefire, or cessation of hostilities, is the prime provisional measure requested by South Africa. In such a scenario, nations and their governments could respond by applying pressure on Israel to comply with the order.\nProvisional measures have recently been provided in cases involving the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the treatment of the Rohingya people in Myanmar.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "ICJ to deliver interim ruling on genocide case against Israel on Friday", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/24/icj-to-deliver-interim-ruling-on-genocide-case-against-israel-on-friday"}
