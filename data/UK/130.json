Women and elderly people were sent to the nearby Kamal Adwan hospital. Men were ordered to undress to their underwear in the street.\nPhotos of dozens of the nearly naked men kneeling in the cold and mud of a ruined street on a December morning prompted outrage around the world. The US said the photos were \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d, and the International Committee of the Red Cross said detainees must be treated with humanity and dignity.\nLubbad, who works at the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, recognised himself in some of the photos. Other civilian detainees identified by friends, family and employers included a young teenager, a man in his 70s and a well-known journalist.\nAs the men waited some soldiers opened fire, injuring a young man\u2019s hand, while others humiliated their captives and destroyed homes, Lubbad said.\n\u201cThe Israeli soldiers photographed us inappropriately and compelled some of the detained boys to dance. They set fire to the homes of the Muqayd, Mahdi, Kahlot and Sorour families in front of us while we were seated in the street,\u201d he said in a statement about his captivity.\nTwo hours later Lubbad was taken just north of Gaza to the beach near Zikim kibbutz, then transported \u201chandcuffed and blindfolded\u201d to an army camp that Israeli soldiers told prisoners was in Ofakim, a city farther inland.\nThere the Gaza residents were herded into shelters surrounded by barbed wire, between 500 and 700 men overlooked by two elevated guard posts for Israeli soldiers. The men had to kneel, their eyes covered, from 5am until midnight.\n\u201cAny attempt to change your position or remove the blindfold resulted in punishment, including standing with hands raised above the head for about three hours and beatings,\u201d Lubbad said.\nThere were interrogations with an investigator who mocked his work, saying: \u201cI\u2019ll teach you your rights well in prison.\u201d\nFive days after he was ordered from his home, he was transferred again. He said he was beaten in the ribs during the move, and was in such severe pain that he was unable to sleep for two nights.\nOther prisoners told him the new facility was in Jabal Mukaber neighbourhood in Jerusalem. He was taken at midday on his first day there for a 10-hour interrogation. The man started the interview by telling Lubbad that he was mentally ill and not taking medication.\nHe demanded information about Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and when Lubbad said he was a civilian activist who didn\u2019t know about the armed groups, the man grew increasingly angry and said Gaza residents would be treated like dogs.\n\u201cThe investigator threatened me and cursed me with obscene words while hitting me in the face. He placed a blindfold over my eyes and went to drink tea or have lunch,\u201d Lubbad said.\n\u201cOn his return, he would ask me the same questions about Hamas and I would answer that I did not know any details and that my social relationships were very limited.\u201d\nTowards the end of the interview, he was blindfolded and taken to sit outside in the freezing night, where he could hear others being beaten. He was then attacked himself, he said. \u201cAfter I could not bear the extreme cold, some soldiers came and beat me and told me \u2018every dog has its day\u2019,\u201d which he took as a death threat.\nAsked about Lubbad\u2019s claims, an IDF spokesperson said \u201cany allegations of improper conduct in the [detention] facility are thoroughly investigated\u201d and that Israeli law and military regulations \u201cdo not permit taking the punitive actions described\u201d.\nThe detention centre mostly held hundreds of Gaza residents who had been working in Israel when Hamas attacked on 7 October. Late on Wednesday night there was a roll call, and soldiers appeared with handcuffs and boxes holding the prisoners\u2019 possessions.\n\u201cCivilian buses appeared, so we knew that they would release us,\u201d he said. The men were handcuffed together for the drive, and reached the Kerem Shalom crossing around midnight, when they were told to cross back into Gaza on foot.\n\u201cI had nothing in my possession except my ID card,\u201d Lubbad said. He contacted his wife and children to tell them he had been released and was back in Gaza, and went to look for somewhere to shelter in Rafah.\nThe intensity of the war in Gaza left little time even for relief that he had survived detention. It was soon overshadowed by a new tragedy. An hour after he crossed back into Gaza, an Israeli airstrike killed his brother.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Gaza activist tells of beating and abuse in Israeli detention", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/21/gaza-activist-tells-of-beating-and-abuse-in-israeli-detention"}
