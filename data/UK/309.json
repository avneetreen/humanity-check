Microsoft and Sony were especially secretive and the only confirmed 2024 releases for either of them are two vague promises for Avowed and Hellblade 2.\nEven Nintendo is being very sketchy about what it has planned for the second half of the year, which may involve the Switch 2\u2026 or may not.\nAs usual, we\u2019ve split our list up into those games that the publisher has confirmed for this year, those that are unconfirmed but reasonably likely, and those games that we either know for a fact aren\u2019t out in 2024 or are otherwise very unlikely. Bear in mind that plans do change, but rarely in terms of bring things forward.\nConfirmed video games for 2024\n18 January \u2013 Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown (XO/PS4/NS/XSX/PS5/PC)\nThe year starts off with the long-awaited reboot of Prince Of Persia, except\u2026 you don\u2019t play as the Prince and it\u2019s actually a Metroidvania. But it does still look good.\n26 January \u2013 Tekken 8 (XSX/PS5/PC)\nPitched as the highest tech fighting game ever made, this will have to be very good to compete with Street Fighter 6, but what we\u2019ve seen of it so far looks very impressive.\n2 February \u2013 Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League (XSX/PS5/PC)\nIt\u2019s been a long, bumpy road for Rocksteady\u2019s co-op live service shooter but it has started looking a little better in recent videos, but will that be enough to overcome its poor reputation?\n16 February \u2013 Skull And Bones (XSX/PS5/PC)\nBy comparison to this Suicide Squad\u2019s development has been plain sailing. A multiplayer pirate sim a decade in the making and yet it\u2019s still hard to fathom who it\u2019s for, especially as Sea Of Thieves already exists.\n29 February \u2013 Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth (PS5)\nThe second part of the remake trilogy is the biggest PlayStation 5 exclusive currently scheduled and considering how well the first part turned out hopes are high that this finds a similarly satisfying balance between old and new.\n8 March \u2013 Unicorn Overlord (PS4/NS/XSX/PS5/PC)\nThe new game from the makers of Dragon\u2019s Crown and 13 Sentinels, this tactical strategy game features Vanillaware\u2019s typically gorgeous artwork and hopefully plays as good as it looks.\n20 March \u2013 Alone In The Dark (XSX/PS5/PC)\nAnother game that\u2019s been delayed several times already. The original is the grandaddy of survival horror and the reboot is from the writer of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, which bodes well.\n22 March \u2013 Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 (XSX/PS5/PC)\nCapcom\u2019s open world action role-player finally returns and it looks pretty much the same as the original, with its faux co-op options that replace human allies with AI-controlled pawns.\n22 March \u2013 Princess Peach: Showtime! (NS)\nThis may end up being the last major first party release for the Switch, as well as being only the second time Peach has had a major game to herself.\n22 March \u2013 Rise Of The R\u014dnin (PS5)\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s going to be a new Nioh game any time soon but this is from the same team and looks very promising, although it appears to be taking a more serious tone, inspired by Ghost Of Tsushima.\nQ1 2024 \u2013 S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl (XO/XSX/PC)\nYou don\u2019t have to ask why Ukrainian developer GSC Game World are taking so long with this but there is every reason to hope its mix of survival horror and first person action will be worth the wait.\n23 April \u2013 Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes (XO/PS4/NS/XSX/PS5/PC)\nThe spiritual successor to Suikoden, by many of the people that worked on the originals, while will hopefully make up for years of disappointing official sequels.\n23 April \u2013 Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU (NS/XSX/PS5/PC)\nAnnounced at The Game Awards, this seems to be an interesting looking Metroidvania based on African mythology, and is apparently a very personal project for the developer.\n4 June \u2013 Destiny 2: The Final Shape (XO/PS4/XSX/PS5/PC)\nConsidering the problems going on at Bungie at the moment this needs to be a success, although either way it\u2019s not clear what comes next, once it ends this chapter of the story.\nQ2 2024 \u2013 Hades 2 early access (PC)\nIt is only early access, and only on PC, but given the popularity of the original this is still going to end up as one of the most talked about games of the year.\n20 August \u2013 Black Myth: Wukong (XSX/PS5/PC)\nIt looks really good in terms of graphics but until we get a feel for how it plays, we\u2019re still not sure what to make of this big budget take on Journey To The West.\n9 September \u2013 Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 (XSX/PS5/PC)\nWarhammer is bigger than ever at the moment, so it\u2019s going to be interesting to see how this fares, although hopefully it\u2019s not quite as one note as the original.\nQ3 2024 \u2013 The First Descendant (XO/PS4/XSX/PS5/PC)\nFor a lot of these games we\u2019ve only got a brief trailer to judge them by, but this turned heads at The Game Awards and is apparently a new looter shooter in the mould of Destiny.\n2024 \u2013 Avowed (XSX/PC)\nThe Outer Worlds maker Obsidian has been working on this Skyrim style role-player for years and we\u2019ve still never seen more than a few seconds of footage, but it is supposed to be out this year.\n2024 \u2013 Senua\u2019s Saga: Hellblade 2 (XSX/PC)\nMicrosoft has at least showed more of Hellblade 2, which is also due out this year and got a fairly extensive gameplay trailer at the recent Game Awards.\n2024 \u2013 Star Wars Outlaws (XSX/PS5/PC)\nUbisoft\u2019s open world scoundrel simulator was supposed to be out earlier in the year but now seems like it\u2019ll be lucky not to be delayed into 2025, but it did look good during its reveal last summer.\nPossible video games for 2024\nFable (XSX/PC)\nMicrosoft showed off a lot of games during its summer games showcase but was intentionally vague about the release dates. The best bet at the moment is that Fable won\u2019t be out until 2025.\nElden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree (XO/PS4/XSX/PS5/PC)\nIt\u2019s much harder to guess what\u2019s going on with Elden Ring\u2019s DLC, as while there are believable rumours about it coming out in February 2024 that would be strange given it wasn\u2019t showcased at The Game Awards in December.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Infinity\nThere\u2019s a bewildering number of Assassin\u2019s Creed due out in the next few years but it seems the next one will be a samurai game currently codenamed Red. Whether it will launch as a standalone title or as part of hub game Infinity is unclear, but it has been rumoured for a late 2024 launch.\nUnlikely video games for 2024\nMarvel\u2019s Wolverine (PS5)\nThe recent Insomniac Games cyberattack revealed that this is aiming for a 2026 release and the Venom spin-off for 2025, although there\u2019s no guarantee those plans haven\u2019t changed already.\nThe Witcher\nAlthough CD Projekt has several Witcher projects underway at the moment it seems the first one will be the remake of the original PC-only game. Since nothing has been seen of it yet it\u2019s probably not coming out this year.\nThe Outer Worlds 2 (XSX/PC)\nAt one point it seemed like this was coming out before Avowed but now it seems to have been put on the back burner, as nothing has been heard about it in years.\nKingdom Hearts 4\nAfter an early flurry of teases, Square Enix hasn\u2019t talked about this in a long while, which seems to rule out a 2024 launch, and probably 2025 as well \u2013 unless you\u2019re being super optimistic.\nDragon Age: Dreadwolf\nBioWare has said there won\u2019t even be any news on the new Dragon Age until 2024 so that seems to rule out a launch this year. The next Mass Effect is going to be even further off.\nNew Tomb Raider\nThe question here is not how the developer is getting on but how badly they\u2019ve been hit by the job cuts at owner Embracer Group. They have been affected but what that\u2019s going to do to the game\u2019s release date is unknown.\nMetroid Prime 4\nThe only first party Switch game we can really guess at, and while the prevailing theory is that it\u2019ll be a Switch 2 launch title that seems far too straightforward and logical for Nintendo.\nGhost Of Tsushima 2\nLikewise, we know nothing about Sony\u2019s plans beyond Insomniac Games, but developer Sucker Punch has been recruiting for a sequel, so presumably it can\u2019t be that far off.\nDeath Stranding 2 (PS5)\nHideo Kojima didn\u2019t say anything about this at The Game Awards so it\u2019s hard to say when it\u2019ll be out, but we\u2019d guess not this year. He also didn\u2019t say much about OD but that also seems unlikely for 2024.\nMonster Hunter Wilds\nIt\u2019s exciting to know a new Monster Hunter is on the way to the next gen consoles, but unfortunately Capcom made it clear it won\u2019t be out until 2025.\nHalf-Life 3\nIs it still worth holding out any hope? Probably not, no.\nGTA 6 (XSX/PS5)\nC\u2019mon, you know it\u2019s not out until 2025, as much as we\u2019d like to pretend there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll be out this year.\nOther confirmed video games for 2024:\n19 January \u2013 The Last Of Us Part 2 Remastered (PS5)\n19 January \u2013 Another Code: Recollection (NS)\n24 January \u2013 Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (XO/PS4/XSX/PS5/PC)\n25 January \u2013 Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy (NS)\n1 February \u2013 Granblue Fantasy: Relink (PS4/PS5/PC)\n2 February \u2013 Persona 3 Reload (XO/PS4/XSX/PS5/PC)\n8 February \u2013 Helldivers 2 (PS5/PC)\n13 February \u2013 Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden (XSX/PS5/PC)\n14 February \u2013 Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered Starring Lara Croft (XO/PS4/NS/XSX/PS5/PC)\n16 February \u2013 Mario Vs.
