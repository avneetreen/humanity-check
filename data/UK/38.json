The Czechs will pay almost \u00a34billion ($5billion) to the US for the aircraft, training of pilots, ammunition and other costs, Ms Cernochova previously said. The remaining money will be used to finance an upgrade of the Caslav air force base in central Czech Republic, fuel and training of staff, she said. In a pointed message to the Russian President, chief of the general staff Lt Gen Karel Rehka said: \u201cThe F-35 is the only system that can help us succeed in the future\u2019s battlegrounds, and that in the case of need, we\u2019ll manage to effectively defend ourselves against aggression, together with our allies.\u201d\nJana Cernochova, Czech Republic defence minister, pictured with US opposite number Lloyd Austin\nBecome an Express Premium member Support fearless journalism\nSupport fearless journalism Read The Daily Express online, advert free\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free Get super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial\nLt.
