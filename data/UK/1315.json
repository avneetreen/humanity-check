Israeli forces on Friday targeted the convoy \u201ctransporting the wounded\u201d from Gaza City towards Rafah in the south, according to the Hamas government in Gaza. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said its ambulance was struck by a missile fired by Israeli forces. The Israel Defense Forces said it carried out an airstrike on an ambulance it said was being used by Hamas, and that \u201ca number of Hamas terrorist operatives\u201d were killed.

But there is no agreement as of yet to actually get this done,\u201d the official said on Friday. Reuters quoted a US official saying there was \u201cindirect engagement\u201d aimed at finding a way to get the hostages out and \u201cit\u2019s something we\u2019re working on extremely hard\u201d, but there was \u201cabsolutely no guarantee\u201d it would happen. An estimated 240 Israeli and foreign hostages were kidnapped by Hamas during its 7 October assault.\nIsrael will continue its offensive in Gaza \u201cwith full force\u201d and refuse any temporary ceasefire that does not include the release of the hostages held by Hamas, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said, rejecting US calls for a pause in the fighting. \u201cI made clear that we are continuing full force and that Israel refuses a temporary ceasefire which does not include the release of our hostages,\u201d he said on Friday.\nIsraeli forces have surrounded Gaza City and are attacking Hamas infrastructure and destroying tunnels used by militants to launch attacks, the Israeli military said on Friday.

AFP said its Gaza City office was significantly damaged by a strike on the building on Thursday. No injuries have been reported.\nIsraeli forces on Friday killed six Palestinians in raids across the West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said, as violence surged in the occupied territory in tandem with the Gaza war.
