Reuters reports that Kim Son Gyong, North Korea\u2019s vice-foreign minister for international organisations, said via KCNA: The United States\u2019 abuse of its veto power to protect an ally that massacred tens of thousands of civilians is not only a manifestation of illegal and unreasonable double standards, but also the height of inhumane evil.

Since the Israel-Hamas war began on 7 October, the frontier between Lebanon and Israel has seen intensifying exchanges of fire, mainly between the Israeli army and Shia Muslim movement Hezbollah, raising fears of a broader conflagration.

Reuters reports: The state department on Friday used an Arms Export Control Act emergency declaration for the tank rounds worth $106.5m for immediate delivery to Israel, the Pentagon said in a statement. The shells are part of a bigger sale that was first reported by Reuters on Friday that the Biden administration is asking the US Congress to approve. The larger package is worth more than $500m and includes 45,000 shells for Israel\u2019s Merkava tanks, regularly deployed in its offensive in Gaza, which has killed thousands of civilians. As the war intensified, how and where exactly the American weapons are used in the conflict has come under more scrutiny, even though US officials say there are no plans to put conditions on military aid to Israel or to consider withholding some of it. Rights advocates expressed concern over the sale, saying it doesn\u2019t align with Washington\u2019s effort to press Israel to minimize civilian casualties. A state department official said on Saturday that Washington continues to be clear with the Israeli government that it must comply with international humanitarian law and take every feasible step to avoid harm to civilians.
