Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\nTrump\u2019s chief goal in attacking Smith, whom he\u2019s labelled a \u201cderanged lunatic\u201d, and other prosecutors and judges is to delay his trials well into 2024, or until after the election, when Trump could pardon himself if he wins, experts say.\nSimilarly, Trump has targeted the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, who has brought a racketeering case in Georgia against Trump and 18 others for trying to overturn Biden\u2019s win there, branding her a \u201crabid partisan\u201d.\nRight before Christmas, Trump\u2019s lawyers asked an appeals court in Washington to throw out Smith\u2019s four-count subversion indictment, arguing that his actions occurred while he was in office and merited presidential immunity, and Trump in a Truth Social post on Christmas Eve blasted Smith for \u201celection interference\u201d.\nIn an 82-page brief rebutting Trump\u2019s lawyers on December 30, Smith and his legal team wrote that Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election results in 2020 \u201cthreaten to undermine democracy,\u201d and stressed Trump\u2019s sweeping immunity claims for all his actions while in office \u201cthreatens to license Presidents to commit crimes to remain in office.\u201d\nFormer justice department officials say Trump\u2019s rhetoric and tactics to tar prosecutors and judges are diversionary moves to distract from the serious charges he faces \u2013 especially for trying to subvert the 2020 election.\nDelay is his major strategic objective in all these cases \u2026 Trump\u2019s constitutional objections to the trial-related issues are all frivolous Former Trump lawyer Ty Cobb\n\u201cClaiming the federal criminal cases or the Georgia Rico action are election interference, and railing constantly about the character of the prosecutors, judges and others, is just a formulaic game to Trump,\u201d Ty Cobb, a White House counsel during the Trump years and a former DoJ official, said.\n\u201cDelay is his major strategic objective in all these cases. These criminal cases were started because of Trump\u2019s criminal acts and his refusal to allow the peaceful transfer of government for the first time in US history. Trump\u2019s constitutional objections to the trial-related issues are all frivolous including his claim of presidential immunity and double jeopardy.\u201d\nCobb added that Trump\u2019s \u201ceveryone is bad but me and I am the victim\u201d rants, lies and frivolous imperious motions and appeals are just his \u201cauthoritarianism in service of his narcissism\u201d.\nOther ex-officials offer equally harsh assessments of Trump\u2019s defenses.\n\u201cThe reality is that Trump has clearly done a series of illegal things and the system is holding him to account for things that he\u2019s done,\u201d said the former deputy attorney general Donald Ayer, who served during the George HW Bush administration. \u201cHe\u2019s telling more lies to mischaracterize prosecutions that we should be thankful for.\u201d\nYet Trump keeps escalating his high-voltage rhetoric and revealing his authoritarian tendencies. Trump even bragged that Russian president Vladimir Putin in December echoed Trump\u2019s charges of political persecution and election interference to bolster his claims.\n\u201cEven Vladimir Putin \u2026 says that Biden\u2019s \u2013 and this is a quote \u2013 \u2018politically motivated persecution of his political rival is very good for Russia because it shows the rottenness of the American political system, which cannot pretend to teach others about democracy\u2019,\u201d Trump told a campaign rally in Durham, New Hampshire.\nFor good measure, Trump complimented two other foreign authoritarian leaders, calling Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, \u201chighly respected\u201d and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un \u201cvery nice\u201d.\nView image in fullscreen Fani Willis is prosecuting Trump and 18 others in Georgia for charges related to election subversion. Photograph: John Bazemore/AP\nIn November Trump sparked fire for slamming his opponents on the left as \u201cvermin\u201d, a term that echoed Adolf Hitler\u2019s language, and the ex-president has more than once pledged in authoritarian style to appoint a special prosecutor to \u201cgo after\u201d Biden and his family.\nLikewise, critics have voiced alarm at Trump\u2019s vow of \u201cretribution\u201d against some powerful foes in both parties if he\u2019s re-elected, including ex-attorney general Bill Barr. That pledge fits with Trump painting himself a victim of a vendetta by \u201cdeep state\u201d forces at the justice department, the FBI and other agencies Trump and his allies want to rein in while expanding his executive authority, if he\u2019s the Republican nominee and wins the presidency again.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Trump on Trial Free newsletter Stay up to date on all of Donald Trump\u2019s trials.

His claim of election interference is meant to give him a kind of political immunity from the consequences of his criminal actions.\n\u201cHe\u2019s basically inviting the public to believe that the legal system\u2019s response to his stealing government documents or trying to overthrow an election are illegal attempts to interfere with his political career.\u201d\nRaskin noted there was some Trump-style logic to citing Putin in his defense.\n\u201cWe know Putin is Trump\u2019s hero and effective cult master,\u201d the congressman said. \u201cSo it makes sense that Trump would try to elevate him as a kind of moral arbiter. Trump would love a world where Vladimir Putin would decide the integrity of elections and prosecutions. Wouldn\u2019t that be nice for the autocrats?\u201d\nTrump\u2019s modus operandi to stave off his trials is emblematic of how he has operated in the past, say some ex-prosecutors.\n\u201cTrump has a habit of picking up allegations made against him and, like a kid in the playground, accusing the critics of doing the same thing\u201d, such as crying \u201celectoral interference\u201d, said the Columbia law professor and former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman.\nRichman stressed that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t assume Trump is trying to mimic other authoritarians. He just shares their values, or the lack of them.\u201d\nOther scholars see Trump\u2019s desperate defenses and incendiary attacks on the legal system as part of his DNA.\nTrump feels entirely emboldened by his supporters. He\u2019s been given license by the Republican party to go as far as he wants Congressman Jamie Raskin\n\u201cThe Trump team is looking to cobble together a defense for the indefensible,\u201d said Timothy Naftali, a senior research scholar at Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs. \u201cTrump has long been looking for and finding ways to protect himself whenever he crosses legal lines. This is who he is.\u201d\nNaftali suggested: \u201cTrump announced his second re-election bid much earlier than is traditional for major candidates. A likely reason why he announced so early \u2013 and then hardly campaigned for a long time \u2013 was to pre-empt any indictments so that he could later denounce them as \u2018election interference\u2019 and perhaps undermine any future trials. This is a man who lies and creates a reality most favorable to him.\u201d\nMore broadly, Raskin views Trump\u2019s attacks on the legal system as hallmarks of fascist rulers.\n\u201cFascism is all about the destruction of the rule of law in the service of a dictator. It\u2019s important for Trump to continue to attack our essential legal institutions. He\u2019s also gotten to the point of dehumanizing his opponents by using words like \u2018vermin\u2019. Violence permeates his rhetoric,\u201d he said.\n\u201cTrump feels entirely emboldened by his supporters. He\u2019s been given license by the Republican party to go as far as he wants.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018A formulaic game\u2019: former officials say Trump\u2019s attacks threaten rule of law", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/01/donald-trump-legal-problems-ex-president-strategy"}
