'Our reservists sacrificed what was dearest to them, so that we could all live here in complete safety.'\nA deadly attack has killed 24 Israeli soldiers in Gaza , the country's military has said. Pictured: Smoke rises over Gaza in the early hours of Tuesday morning\nAccording to a website run by the IDF which posts details on fallen soldiers, those killed in the attack were from the 261st Infantry Brigade - a unit of reserves within the Israeli army's Gaza Division, and the 205th division - a reserve armour brigade.\nThe ages of those identified so far ranged from 23 to 35.\nREAD MORE: British and US troops launch strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen for the second time Advertisement\nThe incident occurred around 4pm in al-Muasi in central Gaza, the Jerusalem Post reported.\nThe deadly attack came as Israeli forces continued to probe deeper into western Khan Younis, the largest city in the south of the Gaza Strip.\nReports said the operation included the storming of a hospital and the arrest on medical staff, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf al Qidra told Reuters.\nEarlier on Monday, the IDF said three soldiers were killed in a separate incident in southern Gaza, taking the total IDF death toll for the day to 24.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead until Israel crushes the ruling Hamas terrorist group and wins the freedom of more than 100 hostages held captive in Gaza.\nIsraelis are increasingly divided on the question of whether it is possible to do either.\nFamilies of the hostages and many of their supporters have called for Israel to reach a ceasefire deal, saying time is running out to bring the hostages home alive.\nOn Monday, dozens of hostages' relatives stormed a parliamentary committee meeting, demanding a deal to win their loved ones' release.\nMonday's heavy death toll could add new momentum to calls for Israel to pause the offensive or even halt it altogether.\nLarge numbers of Israeli casualties have put pressure on Israel's government to halt past military operations.\nNews of the attack came as a senior Egyptian official said Israel has proposed a two-month cease-fire in which the hostages would be freed.\nIn exchange, Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and top Hamas leaders in Gaza would be released and be allowed to relocate to other countries.\nThe official, who was not authorised to brief media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Hamas rejected the proposal and is insisting that no more hostages will be released until Israel ends its offensive and withdraws from Gaza.\nPictured: Some of the Israeli soldiers killed in Monday's attack.
