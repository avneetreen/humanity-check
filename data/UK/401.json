It is terrorism,\u201d he said in remarks at St Peter\u2019s Square on Sunday.\nRev Timothy P Broglio of the Archdiocese for the Military Services and president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote that \u201csuch violence must not continue\u201d, demanding \u201cthe immediate cessation of all hostilities, the release of hostages, and for earnest negotiations towards a peaceful resolution of this conflict.\u201d\n\u201cWe resolutely join our voices with the Holy Father, Pope Francis, reminding all parties in this conflict, that war is never the answer but always a defeat,\u201d he added. \u201cWe plead, \u2018peace, please peace!\u2019\u201d\nTheir statements follow appeals from a growing number of American churches and Christian groups. The National Council of Churches \u2013 the nation\u2019s largest ecumenical body, encompassing 38 Christian faith groups \u2013 joined a letter with 60 other advocacy groups urging President Joe Biden to publicly support a ceasefire, prioritise the protection of all civilians, including the secure admission of humanitarian aid into Gaza and the release of all hostages.\nA letter to the president from Churches from Middle East Peace \u2013 a coalition of more than 30 national Church communions and organisations \u2013 demands his support for \u201cimmediate ceasefire, de-escalation, and restraint by all involved\u201d.\nThe Episcopal Church\u2019s presiding bishop Michael Curry wrote that \u201cthe violence is horrific, and the geopolitics are complex, but my call to love is simple: Stop the killing. Stop all of it. Stop it today.\u201d His letter, written on 7 November as more than 10,000 Palestinians were reported dead, urged world leaders to \u201cstop the next 10,000 from being killed\u201d. Less than two months later, the death toll eclipsed 20,000.\nLast month, with the support of more than 900 Black Christian leaders, clergy purchased a full-page ad in The New York Times to \u201ccall for an immediate bilateral ceasefire in the Middle East for the sake of our shared humanity and our collective security\u201d.\nA group of Black Christian faith leaders have also recently met with White House officials and members of the Congressional Black Caucus to address Gaza\u2019s growing humanitarian crisis.\nPax Christi USA, a national Catholic peace organisation, is holding \u201ccall-in\u201d days asking members to call the president to \u201csupport an immediate ceasefire in Gaza to end the mass slaughter\u201d. A \u201cCeasefire Carols\u201d campaign is staging Christmas carolling across the US to sing songs of peace. Faith leaders and church groups are holding Christian prayer vigils.\nThey are among the many voices joining a chorus of interfaith groups holding demonstrations across the US urging the Biden administration to join global leaders in pressing Israel to support a ceasefire in a conflict that has now killed roughly one in every 100 people in Gaza, including thousands of women and children.\nPalestinians walk among rubble of buildings in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza on 22 December after it was bombed by Israeli airstrikes. (EPA)\nThat scale of destruction in a narrow strip that is home to 2.2 million Palestinians is compounded by warnings of hunger and famine, depleting supplies of clean water and fear of disease, and the mass displacement of 85 per cent of Gaza\u2019s population.\nAn estimated 1,000 Christians lived in Gaza before the war began on October 7, as Israel launched retaliatory bombardments and a ground offensive after Hamas attacks that left 1,200 people dead and took roughly 240 hostages.\nA vast majority of that Christian population is Greek Orthodox, while others are Roman Catholic, Baptist and other Protestant denominations. They are among some of the oldest Christian communities in the world.\nOn 21 October, Gaza\u2019s oldest Greek Orthodox was struck by explosions that killed at least 18 people, according to the Order of St George, an associated order of the church. The dead included family members of former US Rep Justin Amash, the first Palestinian-American member of Congress.\nThe Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, among the oldest jurisdictions in Christendom, condemned the attack.\n\u201cThe Patriarchate stresses that it will not abandon its religious and humanitarian duty, rooted in its Christian values, to provide all that is necessary in times of war and peace alike,\u201d the organisation wrote.\nAmerican Christian groups, reeling from 11 weeks of attacks, are renewing their appeals to end the violence as Palestinian Christian leaders fear the violent erasure of their centuries-old communities.\n\u201cI believe the Christian community will not survive this atrocity,\u201d Rev Mitri Raheb, a Palestinian Lutheran leader in the Israeli-occupied West Bank town of Bethlehem, where Christians believe Jesus was born, told NBC News. \u201cEven those who will survive, who might survive, I\u2019m not sure that they can live in Gaza in a place where life is unlivable.\u201d\nLast month, Palestinian leaders of Christian denominations in Bethlehem \u2013 citing the devastation in Gaza \u2013 unanimously decided against public Christmas celebrations.\nA nun prays in the grotto believed to be the spot where Jesus was born at the Church of the Nativity on 17 December in Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank. (Getty Images)\nMore than 300 people were trapped at the Holy Family Church where an Israeli sniper fatally shot two women. Seven others were shot and wounded at the compound, according to a statement from the Patriarchate.\nThe office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed reports of the attack are \u201cnot true.\u201d\nUK lawmaker Layla Moran, whose family sought refuge inside the church, told members of Parliament that a tank was positioned outside the complex, soldiers fired into the church, and a convent was bombed.\n\u201cThe situation has been desperate for weeks, but now it\u2019s descending,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people in the church \u2026 are civilians. They have nothing to do with Hamas. They are nuns, orphans, disabled people. They are a small Christian community and they know everyone.\u201d\nThe suffering \u201cis not confined to this church,\u201d she said.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "US Christian churches renew urgent calls for ceasefire as Christmas approaches", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/christian-ceasefire-gaza-israel-christmas-b2468659.html"}
