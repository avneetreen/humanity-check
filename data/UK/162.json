The wargames are meant as a fresh show of strength from NATO and its commitment to defend all allied nations from attack.\nAs the war bogs down, and with U.S. and European Union funding for Ukraine\u2019s conflict-ravaged economy held up by political infighting, Bauer appealed for a \u201cwhole of society approach\u201d to the challenge that goes beyond military planning.\n\u201cWe need public and private actors to change their mindset for an era in which everything was plannable, foreseeable, controllable and focused on efficiency to an era in which anything can happen at any time. An era in which we need to expect the unexpected,\u201d he said as he opened the meeting.\n\u201cIn order to be fully effective, also in the future, we need a warfighting transformation of NATO,\u201d Bauer added.\nOn Monday, U.K. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps announced that his government would send 20,000 troops to take part in the NATO military exercises \u2014 known as \"Steadfast Defender\" \u2014 with many deployed in eastern Europe from February to June.\nThe U.K. will also send advanced fighter jets and surveillance planes, plus warships and submarines.\nWith ammunition stockpiles diminishing as allies send military materiel to Ukraine, the Norwegian government said Wednesday it was earmarking 2 billion kroner ($192 million) to boost defense industry production capacity, saying there is \u201ca need for large quantities of ammunition.\u201d\nNorway\u2019s Defense Minister Bj\u00f8rn Arild Gram said that \u201cincreasing capacity in the defense industry is important, both for Ukraine, but also to safeguard our own security.\u201d\nHalf the funds will go to Nammo, a Norway-based aerospace and defense group that specializes in the production of ammunition, rocket engines and space applications, \u201cto increase the production of artillery ammunition,\u201d Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said.\nIn Brussels, Bauer said NATO would continue to support Ukraine long-term.\n\u201cToday is the 693rd day of what Russia thought would be a three-day war. Ukraine will have our support for every day that is to come because the outcome of this war will determine the fate of the world,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis war has never been about any real security threat to Russia coming from either Ukraine or NATO,\u201d Bauer added. \u201cThis war is about Russia fearing something much more powerful than any physical weapon on earth \u2014 democracy. If people in Ukraine can have democratic rights, then people in Russia will soon crave them too.\u201d\n___\nJan M.
