These Soldiers gave the last full measure of devotion in service to this country,\" he began.\n\"This inexcusable loss of life and the attack from terrorists that resulted in these casualties is a reminder of why we stand with the friends of liberty.\n\"The entire Kemp family asks that Georgians everywhere join us in keeping the loved ones of those lost in this attack in our thoughts and prayers in the days ahead.\"\nGeneral Michael Erik Kurilla, the Commander of the US Central Command, shared a tribute as well.\n\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our three Army Soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving their country in Jordan. Our prayers are with these loyal and courageous Soldiers\u2019 families, friends, and the entire 718th Engineer Company - we honor their selfless service and dedication to duty,\" read the X post.", "source_domain": "www.thesun.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Three US soldiers killed in Jordan drone attack pictured by Pentagon after early morning raid struck as they slept", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/25590123/pentagon-soldiers-jordan-killed-drones-middle-east-conflict/"}
