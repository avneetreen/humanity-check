It was almost exactly one year since their last encounter in Bali, Indonesia, on the sidelines of another global gathering.\nIn addition to a formal bilateral meeting, Biden and Xi shared a lunch with top advisers and strolled the verdant grounds of the luxury estate where their meeting took place.\nBiden said afterwards that the meeting included \u201csome of the most constructive and productive discussions we\u2019ve had.\" He added that they will \u201ckeep the lines of communication open\u201d and Xi is \u201cwilling to pick up the phone\u201d \u2014 no small thing in the world of high-risk, high-stakes diplomacy between Washington and Beijing.\nIn another potential sign of warmer feelings, Xi signaled later in the night that China would send new pandas to the United States after the three at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington were returned earlier this month. In a speech, Xi said he wanted to \u201cdeepen the friendly ties between our two peoples.\" Xi also said he learned that Americans \u2014 particularly children \u2014 were \u201creally reluctant\u201d to say goodbye to the rare and popular animals.\nHere's a look at how the rest of the day panned out.\nNEW AGREEMENTS\nBiden left the meeting with commitments on key issues.\nXi agreed to help curb the production of the illicit fentanyl that is a deadly component of drugs sold in the United States. A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting, said the shift will be a setback for Latin American drug dealers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to save lives, and I appreciated President Xi\u2019s commitment on this issue,\" Biden said at a press conference after his meeting.\nIn addition, Biden and Xi reached an agreement to resume military-to-military communications. That means Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will speak with his Chinese counterpart once someone is named to the job, the official said. Similar engagements will take place up and down the military chain of command.\nThe official said Biden was \u201cvery clear\u201d to Xi that such communications between U.S. and China should be institutionalized and that they are \u201cnot done as a gift or as a favor to either side.\"\nBiden said the U.S. and China would talk more about artificial intelligence as well.\n\u201cWe're going to get our experts together and discuss risk and safety issues,\" he said.\nThe agreements helped fulfill the White House's goal for the meeting \u2014 prove to voters that Biden's dedication to personal diplomacy is paying off.\nOn Sunday, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that Biden wanted \u201cpractical ways\u201d to show that meeting with Xi can help \u201cdefend American interests and also deliver progress on the priorities of the American people.\u201d\nZoe Liu, a fellow for China studies at the Council for Foreign Relations, described the meeting between Biden and Xi as a positive step, albeit an incremental one.\n\u201cThese agreements will not change the structural challenges in the bilateral relations, but it paves the way for more detailed working-level discussions, which is more important,\u201d she said.\nBIDEN PRESSES CHINA TO ACT LIKE A SUPERPOWER IN COOLING GLOBAL TENSIONS\nBeijing has long sought to be treated as an equal by Washington, and Biden sought to leverage those ambitions with Xi to address two devastating wars.\nIn their private session, Biden appealed to Xi to use his influence to try to calm global tensions, particularly to try to pressure Iran not to widen the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\nA U.S. official said Biden did most of the talking on the matter, and that Xi mostly listened, and that it was too soon to tell what sort of message China was sending to Tehran and how it was being received.\nBiden has also pressed Xi to continue to withhold military support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nA \u2018CLEAR-HEADED\u2019 EXCHANGE AND A WARNING ON TAIWAN\nBiden and Xi held a \u201cclear-headed\u201d and \u201cnot heated\u201d discussion on Taiwan \u2014 the most sensitive topic in the relationship with the greatest potential to spiral into wider conflict. Biden said he reaffirmed the United States' \u201cOne China\u201d policy and its belief that any resolution must be peaceful.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to change that,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to change.\u201d\nHe reiterated, though, that the U.S. would continue to arm Taiwan as a deterrent against any attempt by China to use force to reunify the self-governing island with the mainland. The U.S. had maintained strategic ambiguity about whether it would directly intervene to protect Taiwan in the event of an invasion by Beijing.\nXi, a U.S. official said, told Biden he had no plans to invade the island, though Biden chided him for China\u2019s massive military build-up around Taiwan. Biden also called on China to avoid meddling in Taiwan's elections next year.\nECONOMIC CHALLENGES\nXi arrived in San Francisco at a time of economic challenges back in China, where an aging population and growing debt have hampered its recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAccording to Beijing's description of the meeting, Xi pressed Biden to lift sanctions and change policies on export controls for sensitive equipment.\n\u201cStifling China\u2019s technological progress is nothing but a move to contain China\u2019s high-quality development and deprive the Chinese people of their right to development,\u201d the readout said. \u201cChina\u2019s development and growth, driven by its own inherent logic, will not be stopped by external forces.\u201d\nThere's no indication that Biden will agree to take such steps. But even the meeting itself could calm jittery nerves back in China, where there have been signs foreign investment is tapering off.\nZhang Lei, a Chinese businessman whose company, Cheche Group, is listed on NASDAQ, said high-level meetings such as the one between Biden and Xi can help assure companies that have been hesitant to invest in China.\n\u201cConfrontations don\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \"You don\u2019t make money with confrontations.\u201d\nIT'S PERSONAL\nBiden and Xi go back years, and Biden often repeats the story of their meetings when they were both vice presidents.\nBut on Wednesday, it was Xi\u2019s turn to reference their previous encounters during brief public remarks, although he eschewed the embellishments that Biden usually adds to the tale.\n\u201cIt was 12 years ago,\u201d Xi said. \u201cI still remember our interactions very vividly, and it always gives me a lot of thoughts.\u201d\nBiden also emphasized the length of their relationship and the value of their interactions.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t always agreed, which was not a surprise to anyone, but our meetings have always been candid, straightforward and useful,\u201d Biden said. He added that \u201cit\u2019s paramount that you and I understand each other clearly, leader to leader, with no misconceptions or miscommunication.\u201d\nBilateral meetings aren't always conducive to a personal touch, and Biden and Xi were flanked by advisers on opposite sides of a long table. However, a senior administration official said they spoke about their wives, and Biden wished Xi's wife a happy birthday.\nThe official, who requested anonymity to discuss a private conversation, said Xi was embarrassed, and he admitted that he had forgotten his wife's upcoming birthday because he's been working so hard.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Didi Tang contributed to this report from San Francisco.
