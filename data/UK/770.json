Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas in response to the 7 October attack, and has unleashed an air and ground campaign that has killed more than 15,000 people, also mostly civilians, the Hamas authorities who run Gaza say. \u201cWhat is the total destruction of Hamas, and does anyone think it\u2019s possible? If it is, the war will last 10 years,\u201d Macron said on Saturday.

Photograph: Thaier Al-Sudani/Reuters After the Israeli army resumed shelling the Gaza Strip on Friday following the collapse of a week-long truce, Macron spoke of the need for \u201cstepped-up efforts to reach a lasting ceasefire\u201d in the conflict. Macron travelled to Doha on Saturday to meet with Qatar\u2019s Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, whose government has been central to diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. But his five-hour stopover in Doha came just after the departure of the Israeli negotiators, with Israel citing a \u201cstalemate\u201d in the talks. Israel and Hamas blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce, which before it expired had enabled the release of 80 Israeli hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. The Israeli army said it had carried out more than 400 strikes in Gaza since the collapse of the ceasefire, while Hamas announced \u201crocket barrages\u201d against multiple Israeli cities and towns including Tel Aviv. Macron had planned to make an extensive tour of the Middle East but instead held meetings about the conflict on the sidelines of UN climate talks. Neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas attended the Dubai summit. In October, Macron met with Netanyahu in Israel. Analysts say Macron\u2019s visits to Dubai and Doha illustrate the difficulty his government faces in finding a way to influence the conflict. \u201cFrance and Macron are not really finding their place in this crisis,\u201d said Agnes Levallois, vice-president of the Institute for Mediterranean Middle East Research and Studies.\n3 Dec 2023 04.29 CET Summary We are pausing our coverage temporarily, and will move to a new blog soon. Here is where things stand: Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed the IDF will continue its assault on Gaza with intensified force until they have achieved the total elimination of Hamas. Strikes on Palestinian territory continued overnight, according to Palestinian media.\nIn Dubai, French leader Emmanuel Macron has warned that seeking the elimination of Hamas risked unleashing a decade of war. \u201cI think we\u2019re at a point where the Israeli authorities are going to have to define their objective and desired end state more precisely,\u201d he said on the sidelines of the COP28 forum.\nThe UK has announced that it will conduct surveillance flights over the eastern Mediterranean, including operating in air space over Israel and Gaza \u201cin support of hostage rescue activity.\u201d In a statement released on Saturday, the UK government said, \u201cSurveillance aircraft will be unarmed, do not have a combat role, and will be tasked solely to locate hostages. Only information relating to hostage rescue will be passed to the relevant authorities responsible for hostage rescue.\u201d\nTwo Qatar Armed Forces aircraft carried aid for Palestinians in Gaza on Saturday, the Qatari foreign ministry announced. The two aircraft carried 62 tons of aid consisting of food supplies and shelter equipment. Saturday\u2019s delivery from Qatar brings the total amount of aid planes sent to Gaza from Qatar to 35.\nThe US defense secretary Lloyd Austin urged Israel to protect civilians on Saturday as Israel increases its attacks across Gaza, which have killed more than 15,200 Palestinians in the last two months. Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California, Austin said, \u201cIn this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.\u201d\nThere are around 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza with more than 180 giving birth daily, according to UNRWA, the main UN agency for Palestinian refugees. \u201cPost-natal care continues in shelters, but conditions are not at all suitable for newborns,\u201d the agency said.\nThe deputy Hamas chief Saleh al-Arouri told Al Jazeera on Saturday that no more hostages would be exchanged with Israel until there is a ceasefire in Gaza, Reuters reports. According to Arouri, the hostages still held by Hamas were Israeli soldiers and civilian men who had previously served in the Israeli army. The remaining hostages will not be released unless there is a ceasefire and all Palestinians held in Israeli prisons are also released.\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society received 100 aid trucks through the Rafah border crossing on Saturday, the humanitarian organization announced. The trucks contained food, water, relief assistance, medical supplies and medicines, the PRCS said.\nAn Israeli military spokesman has defended the IDF\u2019s use of artificial intelligence following reports by the Guardian and the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and partner Hebrew-language outlet Local Call about how it is using an AI-driven tool to select bombing targets in Gaza. Responding to a question from an X user in a Spaces conversation, IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus said, \u201cIn anything that is generated by a machine, there\u2019s always a human in the loop that has definitive and executive say over whatever is generated by a machine \u2026 and they are accountable for their decisions.\u201d\nUnicef has condemned the \u201congoing war on children\u201d as Israel resumed strikes on Gaza swiftly after the truce between Israel and Hamas expired on Friday. Speaking to journalists at the UN office in Geneva via video link from Khan Younis, Unicef spokesperson James Elder said: \u201cThe bombs started just a few seconds after the ceasefire [ended],\u201d before decrying the \u201congoing war on children.\u201d\nThe US vice-president, Kamala Harris, said on Saturday that \u201cunder no circumstance will the United States permit the forced relocation of Palestinians\u201d, according to a statement released by the White House. It stated, \u201cThe vice president reiterated that under no circumstances will the United States permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, the besiegement of Gaza, or the redrawing of the borders of Gaza.\u201d\nPalestinian human rights groups refused to meet the international criminal court prosecutor Karim Khan on Saturday, accusing him of favouring Israeli accusations of rights abuses over longstanding Palestinian charges. Khan has been visiting Israel and the occupied West Bank following a request by a group representing families of victims of the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen, but he was also due to meet Palestinian officials in Ramallah. However, Palestinian activists said they would refuse to see him because they objected to what they saw as unequal treatment of Israeli and Palestinian cases, according to Reuters.\n3 Dec 2023 03.50 CET The IDF says the rocket warning sirens activated in Ashkelon and other towns near the Gaza border were a false alarm, according to the Times of Israel.\n3 Dec 2023 03.32 CET Fighting is continuing overnight, as Palestinian media reports Israeli air and artillery strikes in Gaza. Israeli media is also reporting rocket warning sirens in the coastal cities of Ashkelon, Sderot and other towns near the border with the Gaza Strip. #\u0641\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648| \u0645\u0634\u0647\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0646\u064a\u0641 \u0648\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0628\u0648\u0642 \u0641\u064a \u062e\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0633 \u062c\u0646\u0648\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0639 pic.twitter.com/5LXpGPlsYo \u2014 \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0634\u0647\u0627\u0628 \u0644\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0628\u0627\u0621 (@ShehabAgency) December 2, 2023\n3 Dec 2023 02.50 CET A few hours ago the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, held a press conference vowing to continue the ground assault \u201cwith increasing force\u201d, saying it was the only way to achieve Israel\u2019s goal of \u201celiminating Hamas and releasing our hostages\u201d. He said the IDF and security forces were continuing the ground incursion while upholding international law \u2013 a claim which has been repeatedly called into question by some human rights observers and world leaders including the Spanish prime minister just last week. Netanyahu said soldiers had prepared for ongoing fighting \u201cwith full force\u201d during the pause in fighting. \u201cThe day before yesterday I directed the IDF, together with the War Cabinet, to resume fighting, with increasing force. In the last 24 hours, we have destroyed over 400 Hamas terrorist targets. We carried out extensive aerial attacks in Khan Yunis. We eliminated terrorists and infrastructure in Beit Lahiya. We are continuing to act in the northern Gaza Strip.\u201d He said Israel was \u201creturning fire many times over\u201d, and issued a warning to Hezbollah, the Lebanese group allied with Hamas and which has been exchanging fire with Israeli forces. \u201cLet it be clear: We are committed to restoring security both in the south and the north. If Hezbollah makes a mistake and enters into a broad war, it will be destroying Lebanon with its own hands.\u201d\n3 Dec 2023 02.01 CET Israel plan to eliminate Hamas risks a decade of war: Macron French President Emmanuel Macron warned Saturday that Israel\u2019s aim of eliminating Hamas risked unleashing a decade of war. \u201cI think we\u2019re at a point where the Israeli authorities are going to have to define their objective and desired end state more precisely,\u201d Macron said at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN\u2019s COP28 climate talks in Dubai.

The hostages, who were taken during the 7 October attacks, spoke in a video broadcast to a crowd of thousands about the fear, hunger, and sleeplessness of their captivity. \u201cOur daughters saw things that children at that age - or of any age - don\u2019t need to see,\u201d said Danielle Aloni, 45, who was released last week along with her five-year-old daughter. \u201cThe food wasn\u2019t plentiful to start with, and as time passed, the food dwindled,\u201d said 84-year-old Ditza Heiman, who was released Tuesday. The freed hostages urged the government to take all action necessary to secure the remaining captives\u2019 release. Yocheved Lifschitz, 85, who was released by Hamas in October, outside the parameters of the truce deal, said \u201cthe moral obligation of this government is to bring them home immediately, without hesitation\u201d. Their comments came a day after the collapse of the US-Qatari mediate truce that saw the release of 80 Israeli hostages, mostly women and children, in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners over the course of a week.

He went on to add: The lesson is not that you can win in urban warfare by protecting civilians. The lesson is that you can only win in urban warfare by protecting civilians \u2026 In this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population.

Agence France-Presse reports: At almost exactly the same time Israeli negotiators pulled out of deadlocked truce talks in Qatar on Saturday, Israeli jets sent a prestige Doha-funded housing development in the Gaza Strip up in smoke. Hamad City is named for the former emir of the Gulf petro-state, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, who laid the foundation stone on a visit 11 years ago. Inaugurated in 2016, it was still among the newest projects in the Gaza Strip, [with] the housing complex in the city of Khan Younis boasting an impressive mosque, shops and gardens. The first flats \u2013 more than 1,000 of them \u2013 were provided to Palestinians whose homes were destroyed in the war between Israel and Hamas two years earlier. On Saturday it happened again, a day after a Qatar-brokered pause in the current war between Israel and Hamas expired. First their phones pinged around noon with an \u201cimmediate\u201d evacuation-order SMS sent by the Israeli army, which says the system is aimed at minimising civilian casualties. Around an hour later, five Israeli air strikes rained down on the neighbourhood in the space of just two minutes. Bombs slammed into the pale apartment blocks one by one, reducing them largely to rubble and sending a huge pall of black smoke into the sky, as people fled and cries of \u2018help!\u2019 and \u2018ambulance!\u2019 rang out. \u201cAt least we got through it,\u201d 26-year-old Nader Abu Warda told AFP, amazed he was still alive.\n2 Dec 2023 21.42 CET Aid workers are warning that Israel\u2019s new grid system for targeted evacuation warnings in southern Gaza risks turning life for Palestinians into a \u201cmacabre game of Battleships\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Emma Graham-Harrison and Jason Burke report: Israel has started using its new grid system for evacuation warnings, which breaks Gaza down into more than 600 blocks, and can be accessed through a QR code on leaflets and social media posts. It appears designed to allow the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to try to shuffle civilians around in a shrinking battle space as they target Hamas fighters, by ordering them to leave areas that in some cases cover just a few blocks. But on the ground, people said it had just added to their fear and confusion. After weeks of bombardment and blockades, most people have little access to electricity to charge phones and other devices, and even for those who can get online, the telecommunications system regularly collapses. That means residents have no reliable way of accessing the map, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said.
