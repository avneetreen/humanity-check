The realisation that we will not get the hug we wished for leaves us speechless.'\nWhile it is not known exactly which group currently holds the family, military analyst Michael Horowitz said: 'It appears they may be in the hands of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).'\nThe PFLP is one of the largest groups that form the political coalition that claims to represent the West Bank and Gaza.\nIt does not recognise Israel as a state, and has historically pushed for a one-state solution with Palestine at the steering wheel.\nThe hostages are now safely back in Israel, after spending weeks in Hamas' custody\nThe hostages released last night were largely made up of young children, teenagers and mothers\nThe hostages were handed over to the Red Cross last night\nREAD MORE: Moment 11 more Israeli hostages including nine children arrive back in Israel after spending seven weeks in Hamas captivity in Gaza Advertisement\nThe group are believed to be holding the Bibas family in Khan Younis, the Gaza Strip's second city, which in 2017 was home to just over 205,000 people.\nThough they may be held by a different group, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the responsibility for the hostages remained with Hamas.\nThe city is set to be the next target in Israel's bloody offensive against the Gaza Strip, which has so far killed over 14,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\nIsrael urged Palestinians living in the city to leave just over a week ago, suggesting it will soon be the site of renewed fighting once the now-extended ceasefire concludes.\nMark Regev, an adviser to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, told MSNBC earlier this month: 'We're asking people to relocate. I know it's not easy for many of them, but we don't want to see civilians caught up in the crossfire.\nMr Regev said that IDF troops would need to go into the city to take out Hamas fighters from underground tunnels.\nSahar Kalderon, 16, was held by Hamas for over seven weeks, and was today released under the extended ceasefire deal\nErez Kalderon, 12, was today released by Hamas terrorists after being captive for over seven weeks\nHe said he was 'pretty sure' Palestinians who needed to relocate from the city 'won't have to move again' if they headed west, towards the Mediterranean Sea.\nIt is currently unclear when fighting in the Gaza Strip will resume, as Hamas and Israel are currently nearing the end of a since-extended ceasefire.\nThe temporary truce, originally set for Friday, Saturday and Sunday, was extended just hours before the agreement was due to end, suggesting that more hostages will be released from Gaza this week.\nThe terms of the truce agreement, pausing the fighting in the Gaza Strip, say it can be extended beyond its initial four-day term as long as 10 hostages are released for each extra day, with three times as many Palestinians freed in return.\nQatar's foreign ministry said the truce had been extended by two more days, suggesting Hamas intends to release another 20 hostages on top of the 50 that were set to be freed over the first four days.\nEleven more hostages held by Hamas are now back on Israeli soil, after the fourth exchange of hostages and prisoners.\nThe brothers were seen in good spirits wearing earmuffs in a convoy that is currently taking them back to Israel\nDespite the smiles, many of the children released have been forced to leave members of their families behind\nBrothers Tal Goldstein-Almog, 9, and Gal Goldstein-Almog, 11, were seen in the company of 'an elite unit of the IDF', as spokesperson Daniel Hagari described them\nIDF spokesperson Mr Hagari said last night that 'an elite unit of the IDF' accompanied the group, all young children, teenagers and mothers, back to Israel, where they will undergo a medical assessment.\n'Our forces will accompany the returnees until they reach their families in the hospitals.'\nAll 11 hostages, made up of three French citizens, two German citizens and six Argentinian citizens, released were taken by Hamas from Kibbutz Nir Oz, a settlement just a mile-and-a-half away from the Gaza border with a pre-incursion population of around 400.\nThe hostages, almost all of whom are young children and teenagers, have been named as: Yuli Cunio, three, Emma Cunio, three, Sharon Aloni Cunio, 34, Karina Engelbert, 51, Yagil Jacob, 12, Erez Kalderon, 12, Sahar Kalderon, 16, Or Jacob, 16, Yuval Engel, 11, Mika Engel, 18, and Eitan Yahalomi, 12.\nBut fears from earlier last night that Hamas would split up families have seemingly been confirmed, as many of the children released have been forced to leave their loved ones behind.\nAll 11 hostages came from the same settlement, Kibbutz Nir Oz, which lies just a mile-and-a-half away from the Gaza border and had a pre-incursion population of around 400\nDespite the happy scenes, a spokesperson for the hostages families last night told MailOnline: 'Every single child that has been released tonight is being returned while their father is being left in Hamas captivity in Gaza'\nThe Cunio family are still missing their father, David, after they were all taken from Nir Oz during Hamas' incursion.\nTwelve-year-old Eitan will also be missing his father, Ohad, who remains a Hamas prisoner.\nEitan's mother, Bat Sheva, previously revealed that motorcycle riding Hamas militants tried to kidnap her and her children from their Nir Oz home, but she managed to jump off with her two daughters.\nShe added that she was terrified that her Manchester City-supporting son will not be the same following his seven-week stint as a hostage.\nThe Kalderon family, who will soon be reunited with 16-year-old Sahar and 12-year-old Erez, are also missing their father, 53-year-old Oher.\nIt is not currently known whether the hostages released last night ever had contact with other members of their family who were also being held by Hamas.\nA spokesperson for the hostages families last night told MailOnline: 'Every single child that has been released tonight is being returned while their father is being left in Hamas captivity in Gaza. Very hard to swallow.'\nThe Red Cross was waiting for the hostages for the fourth time in as many days\nImages of Hamas handing over the 11 hostages revealed its militants stood in a parade as the civilians walked towards a Red Cross van\nAll 11 hostages came from the same settlement, Kibbutz Nir Oz. The head of the kibbutz, Osnat Peri, last night said in a statement: 'The news this evening brings a sigh of relief to our community.'\nHe said that he and his community are still 'deeply concerned about our loved ones that are still held hostage', adding that of the hostages still left in Gaza, 49 are from Nir Oz.\nThree of the hostages were French, and the country's president Emmanuel Macron last night said in a post to X: 'Three of our young compatriots are part of the group of hostages released today.\n'Extremely happy with this announcement.'\nImages of Hamas handing over the 11 hostages revealed its militants stood in a parade as the civilians walked towards a Red Cross van, which took them back to Israeli officials.\nOne as-yet-unidentified hostage was seen leaving Hamas custody in a wheelchair, while several others were seen in bright pink clothes.\nRaz Asher (left), four, her two-year-old sister Aviv (right) and their mother Doron, 34, reunite with their father and husband Yoni at the Schneider Children's Medical Center\nKeren Munder, 54, and her son Ohad Munder, age 9, with his father and a family member at the Schneider Children's Medical Center.
