Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they had struck about 250 targets in Gaza over a 24-hour period, ending on Thursday morning.\nAbout 1.87 million people in Gaza \u2013 more than 80% of the population of 2.3 million \u2013 have fled their homes in the past two months, according to the UN. Many families have been displaced multiple times, and are living in tents and overcrowded makeshift shelters.\nThe mass civilian casualties in the conflict have sparked global concern, heightened by dire shortages caused by an Israeli siege that has seen only limited access for food, water, fuel and medicines in Gaza.\n00:01:45 Palestinians suffer cold with lack of shelter and barely any food in Gaza 'safe zone' \u2013 video\nOn Thursday, Israel agreed at the request of the United States to open the Kerem Shalom border crossing in southern Gaza for the screening and inspection of trucks and their cargo, for the first time since the outbreak of the war.\nIf that were to happen, UN aid chief Martin Griffith said it would represent a major boost for humanitarian operations. \u201cIt would be the first miracle we\u2019ve seen for some weeks, but would also be a huge boost to the logistical process and logistical base of a humanitarian operation,\u201d he said.\nEgypt, along with the United Nations, has been lobbying Israel to speed up an inspection process, which requires the vehicles to drive to Egypt\u2019s border with Israel before looping back to Rafah. The number of trucks crossing daily has dropped to fewer than 100, from nearly 200 during the short-lived truce, according to the United Nations.\nCol Elad Goren, from Israel\u2019s Cogat military liaison to the Palestinians, did not give a date for the opening of the crossing, and said the crossing point would be used to increase the capacity to inspect aid trucks, but not to allow aid into Gaza directly.\nThe White House said that Biden called for more assistance for civilians in Gaza in his call with Netanyahu on Thursday.\nThe US president added that \u201cmuch more assistance was urgently required across the board\u201d.\nOn Friday, the UN Security Council will meet to vote on urging an immediate ceasefire.\nReuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "US highlights \u2018gap\u2019 in Israel\u2019s commitment to protect civilians in Gaza", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/08/us-israel-hamas-war-gaza-civilian-protection-anthony-blinken"}
