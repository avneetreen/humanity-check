And no special hashtag for the defiled women of Israel.\nIt appeared that sympathy for the Palestinian cause meant some could find no place in their hearts for raped and butchered Israeli women.\nIt led Israeli tech boss Danielle Ofek to launch a campaign on Twitter/X with the hashtag #MeTooUnlessUrAJew \u2014 its aim to gather a million signatures to acknowledge that every woman\u2019s life is equally precious.\nDespite the deafening silence, multiple heart-wrenching accounts of the rape and mutilation of women have emerged since the massacre.\nThis week the BBC told how Israeli police had shown journalists the video testimony of another Supernova survivor.\nIt\u2019s an extremely shocking and graphic account of barbarity.\nThe woman, known as Witness S, first told how Hamas passed a female partygoer from one attacker to another.\nThen she said: \u201cShe was alive. She was bleeding from her back. They sliced her breast and threw it on the street. They were playing with it.\u201d\nWitness S then told how the victim was passed to another man in uniform, who shot her in the head while he was raping her.\nThe BBC also quoted a survivor from the festival saying in a statement: \u201cSome women were raped before they were dead, some raped while injured, and some were already dead when the terrorists raped their lifeless bodies.\n\u201cI desperately wanted to help, but there was nothing I could do.\u201d\nAnd a morgue worker said: \u201cThere is evidence of mass rape so brutal that they broke their victims\u2019 pelvis \u2014 women, grandmothers, children.\u201d\nPhotographs from massacre sites show dead women naked from the waist down, or with their underwear ripped to one side, their legs splayed and with signs of trauma to their genitals and legs.\nIsraeli police commander Shelly Harush, leading the investigation into the rapes, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear now that sexual crimes were part of the planning, and the purpose was to terrify and humiliate people.\u201d\nIsrael\u2019s Women\u2019s Empowerment Minister May Golan said the \u201cvery, very few\u201d victims of rape or sexual assault who survived the attacks were having psychiatric treatment.\nShe added: \u201cThe majority were brutally murdered. They aren\u2019t able to talk \u2014 not with me, and not to anyone from the government or from the media.\u201d\nMost social media users would have seen the highly distressing images of a handcuffed woman taken hostage, with cuts to her arms and her trousers bloodstained.\nYet the silence from many has left Israeli women feeling ignored by the global feminist movement.\nThe United Nations organisation UN Women \u2014 which calls itself \u201cthe global champion for gender equality\u201d \u2014 had nothing initially to say after the mass rapes on October 7.\nDespite publishing a report on women in the region a few days after the outrage, it remained silent.\n\u2018Unverified accusation\u2019\nNearly two months after the rape and murder spree \u2014 and following intense lobbying by Israeli women\u2019s groups \u2014 UN Women finally acknowledged the sexual attacks.\nIt released a statement saying the organisation was \u201calarmed by the numerous accounts of gender-based atrocities and sexual violence\u201d during the October attacks.\n5 One woman was wedged between two fanatics as they carried her away on a motorbike Credit: AP\n5 Noa Argamani, 25, was snatched from a music festival as she begged for her life Credit: Supplied\nBut Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen slammed the statement as \u201cweak and late\u201d.\nIn Canada an open letter has been gathering signatures among politicos, but rather than decry the Hamas killings and sexual attacks, it denied that women were raped.\nIt criticised opposition New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh for having \u201crepeated the unverified accusation that Palestinians were guilty of sexual violence.\u201d\nAstonishingly, it was signed by Samantha Pearson, director of the University of Alberta\u2019s Sexual Assault Centre.\nThe Jewish Federation of Edmonton wrote: \u201cShouldn\u2019t a sexual assault centre believe all victims, and not just the non-Jewish ones?\u201d\nPearson was fired from her role.\nIn Britain, Guardian newspaper posterboy Owen Jones \u2014 who was at a screening of Hamas atrocities put together by the Israeli Government \u2014 said there was no \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d of rape in the images he witnessed.\nHe added: \u201cIf there was rape and sexual violence committed, we don\u2019t see that on camera.\u201d\nThe Israel Defense Forces said only footage that \u201cpreserved the dignity\u201d of those killed was used out of respect to their families.\nIt was left to fellow Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff to point out last week that after reports of the rape of Yazidi and Ukrainian women she couldn\u2019t remember \u201ctoo many sceptics demanding to see video proof\u201d.\nJones later tweeted: \u201cAll allegations of rape and sexual assault must be investigated, including those alleged against Hamas during 7th October atrocity\u201d.\nOn Tuesday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a Press conference: \u201cI say to the women\u2019s rights organisations, to the human rights organisations, you\u2019ve heard of the rape of Israeli women, horrible atrocities, sexual mutilation \u2014 where the hell are you?\u201d\nLast week UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres finally said that the \u201cnumerous accounts of sexual violence during the abhorrent acts of terror by Hamas\u201d should be \u201cvigorously investigated\u201d.\nIsraeli author Hen Mazzig tweeted: \u201cSo, it took the top man in the humanitarian world almost TWO MONTHS to believe women and say that there are \u201creports\u201d of rape that should be investigated?\n\u201cNo, sir, it must be condemned, NOW, with your full chest.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.thesun.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Israeli women were raped and mutilated at gunpoint as they begged to be killed - could Hamas animals sink any lower?", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/24971348/israeli-women-raped-october-hamas-attack/"}
