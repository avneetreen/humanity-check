We've had therm before, I suppose, [we] will check the circumstances in order to enable goods, humanitarian good to come in, or our hostages, individual hostages to leave.'\nHamas are holding at least 240 people hostage in Gaza, according to Israeli authorities, taking scores back into the enclave on October 7. The hostages include 33 children, older people, foreigners or dual citizens, and Israeli soldiers.\nFour civilian hostages have so far been released - two on October 20 and two on October 24.\nQatar is currently mediating negotiations between Israel and Hamas for the potential release of between 10 to 15 more hostages in exchange for a short ceasefire, it was reported today.\nThe ceasefire would last between one and two days, during which up to 15 hostages captured by Hamas gunmen on October 7 will be released, a source briefed on the talks said today.\nNetanyahu's other comments on the potential 'security responsibility' over Gaza prompted questions from onlookers including the United States.\n'Reoccupation by Israeli forces of Gaza is not the right thing to do,' White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said.\nBut he added: 'Israel and the United States are friends and we do not have to agree on every single word...

But clearly the risks coming out of that territory are now considered unacceptable,' he said.\n'Israel should think twice if this is the right way forward.'\nFears also mount that the war could become a wider regional conflict, with Iran backing Hamas allies in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen against Israel.\nThe war has already seen Israel clash several times on the southern border with Hezbollah forces in Lebanon.\nAnd Israel has sent missile boats to the Red Sea to head off potential strikes from Iran-backed forces in Yemen.\nIsrael has made steady gains following weeks of devastating strikes into the Gaza Strip.\nIsraeli troops are now advancing 'deep inside' Gaza City where they are fighting intense and bloody battles against Hamas.\n'We are in the heart of Gaza City,' Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said today, adding Israel was 'tightening the noose'.\nCombat engineers are now using explosive devices to destroy a tunnel network that stretches for hundreds of miles beneath the territory.\nAmid the invasion, the Israel Defense Forces today claimed to have killed a Hamas weapons boss and cornered the mastermind of the horrific October 7 massacre in his bunker as Israeli forces continue to advance 'deep inside' Gaza City.\nIsraeli airstrikes 'eliminated' leading Hamas armourer Mahsein Abu Zina and several terrorists who were attacking IDF troops with ground-to-ground rocket fire, the military said today.\nIsraeli troops also managed to corner Yahya Sinwar, the most senior Hamas leader in Gaza and believed to be a key planner of the October 7 attacks that left 1,400 Israelis dead, in his bunker.\nTroops reportedly managed to corner Yahya Sinwar (pictured left in Gaza City on April 30, 2022), the most senior Hamas leader in Gaza, and 'eliminate' top armourer Mahsein Abu Zina\nThousands of civilians have died since October 7, 2023, after Hamas entered Israel in an unprecedented attack triggering a war declared by Israel with retaliatory bombings on Gaza\nPalestinians react as they check the rubble of a building, in Khan Yunis on November 6, 2023\nThe death toll in Gaza hit a bleak milestone this week, with more than 10,000 people killed according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Gaza is 'becoming a graveyard for children' and restated calls for a ceasefire.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Hamas reveals its plan for 'permanent war with Israel': Terror group says it hopes 'the Arab world will stand with us' and boasts 'no-one in the region is experiencing calm'", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12725765/Hamas-reveals-plan-permanent-war-Israel-Terror-group-says-hopes-Arab-world-stand-boasts-no-one-region-experiencing-calm.html"}
