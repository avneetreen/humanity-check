Ever since the commencement of the sales of M-Code GPS receivers, their sales have been increasing exponentially, eroding the market share of the traditionally used P (Y) Code receivers. These advanced devices are designed to enhance the PNT capabilities of armed units and provide improved resistance to existing and emerging threats to GPS such as jamming and spoofing. Therefore, it is estimated that the M-Code GPS receivers will completely replace the P(Y) Code receivers in the coming decade.\nBased on frequency type- The market is segmented into single-frequency GPS receivers and dual-frequency GPS receivers. Dual-frequency GPS receivers are widely used over their single-frequency counterparts due to their greater accuracy and greater resistance to multipath errors, which are fairly common for the latter. Furthermore, if any one of the two frequencies fails, the other one works as a backup, thus ensuring uninterrupted signal transmission.\nBased on application type- The military GPS receiver market is segmented into aviation-based GPS receivers, ground-based GPS receivers, PGM-based GPS receivers, handheld GPS receivers, and maritime equipment-based GPS receivers. Among these application types, the PGM-based application is estimated to remain the supreme market leader for military GPS receivers in the coming years, as these GPS systems form an essential component in the PGMs (such as missiles, bombs, and projectiles). Moreover, with the increasing hostilities across the globe, the demand for PGMs has been increasing manifold, thereby, fueling the market growth.\nTo know the attractive segments, click here for a free sample pdf:\nhttps://www.stratviewresearch.com/Request-Sample/2882/military-gps-receivers-market.html#form\nWhich Region Offers the Best Opportunity and Growth?\nThe report suggests that North America is expected to remain the largest market for military GPS receivers market during the forecast period. This growth is majorly attributed to the following -\nThe country has been extensively investing in military GPS receivers to enhance the overall capabilities of its armed forces.\nFurthermore, market-leading companies, such as BAE Systems, L3Harris Technologies, Inc., and Raytheon Corporation, are present in the region, giving North America an unrivaled advantage over other regions.\nMilitary GPS Receivers Market Drivers\nSome of the key drivers listed in the report are given below.\nThe usage of military GPS receivers is expanding around the world as several military missions and operations rely heavily on the transmission of real-time data, thereby, augmenting the growth of the overall industry.\nThese GPS-enabled devices not only provide accurate target tracking and route navigation but also offer precise digital mapping solutions.\nThe global rise in border disputes and terrorist threats, many countries are focusing on improving the capabilities of their military forces, which has resulted in a significant increase in the overall deployment of military GPS receivers in recent years.\nFor Customization or Any Other Queries, Get in Touch with Our Industry Experts at sales@stratviewresearch.com\nTop 10 Companies in Military GPS Receivers Market?\nIn recent years, there has been competition in the military GPS receiver market.
