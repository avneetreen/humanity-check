They are now among the 126,000 displaced Israelis living in hotels across the country in the wake of the 7 October attacks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d Jonathan Shamriz said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t fully understand what happened. We still haven\u2019t fully grieved for everyone.\n\u201cMy best friends are dead, my brother is kidnapped, and when you walk through the kibbutz, it\u2019s no place to return to.\u201d\nView image in fullscreen Alon Shamriz, who was kidnapped by Hamas from kibbutz Kfar Aza. Photograph: handout\nThe task of evacuating and finding accommodation for the people of Kfar Aza and 31 other kibbutzim and moshavim close to the Gaza border was coordinated by a local government official, Dikla Katzuni Azerad of the Eshkol regional council. She described it as an \u201cunprecedented and very, very complicated\u201d operation that is costing 5.2m shekels (\u00a31.1m) a week.\nThe council had a pre-existing programme, Mashav Ruach, meaning Breeze, for evacuating the 11 kibbutzim up to 4km (2.5 miles) from the Gaza border, but it quickly became clear it would have to be expanded to include all 32 of the region\u2019s kibbutzim and moshavim.\n\u201cWe realised the scale of the massacre,\u201d Azerad said. \u201cThe attack surprised everyone. I didn\u2019t have a plan for everyone. I couldn\u2019t just pull hotels out of my pocket.\u201d The council eventually evacuated 13,000 of its 16,000 residents.\nDisplaced Israelis are now residing in 280 guest houses and hotels across the country, including in the Red Sea resort of Eilat, according to the Israeli defence ministry.\nIt added that as well as those in Gaza border communities, it had evacuated 23,000 people from the northern city of Kiryat Shmona and 38,000 from areas nearby. The ministry said a further 49,000 people were moved as part of a \u201crevitalisation programme\u201d for those affected by the war.\nIn Gaza, two-thirds of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced to the south, according to the United Nations, and the death toll from Israeli bombardment has reached 13,000, including 5,500 children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.\nAzerad described scenes of chaos as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) extracted from safe rooms startled families who were desperate to leave \u201ceven if they were barefoot and naked\u201d.\n\u201cYou see a grown woman wearing SpongeBob SquarePants pyjamas and she\u2019s holding her babies,\u201d she said. \u201cWe took mothers and kids in the middle of the night, and all around them were dead bodies and explosions and they don\u2019t know who was alive and who was dead.\n\u201cWe put them on armoured buses and took them out without clothes, without bags. So it was a very, very emotional operation but I needed to, for my mental health, to focus on the logistics. We were saving lives. Afterwards we do everything else.\u201d\nView image in fullscreen Lt Col Yaron Buskila, an operation officer of the IDF\u2019s Gaza Division, stands in front of a destroyed home as he revisits kibbutz Kfar Aza, where he was one of the first to arrive on 7 October. Photograph: Amir Cohen/Reuters\nThe Shamriz family were among those rescued. They, along with Jonathan\u2019s parents and two siblings, are now living in a coastal hotel 12 miles north of Tel Aviv.\nThere, the family and 400 other people from Kfar Aza, one of the hardest-hit communities, are provided with three meals a day and handouts from charities and volunteers. Officials have had to visit the hotel to issue evacuees with new passports and ID cards.\n\u201cNone of my clothes or shoes are here, or basic things like deodorant or shampoo. Nothing. But I don\u2019t really care for those things as long as my brother is in Gaza,\u201d Shamriz said.\nShamriz, who runs a wood importation business, has asked if he can change the date of his daughter\u2019s birthday, as the family are so haunted by the events of 7 October.\nAs news of Hamas\u2019s attack broke on the kibbutz\u2019s WhatsApp group, the family fled to their safe room with water and a cake they had prepared for Yali\u2019s birthday. They laid her down on a bed and played her YouTube videos to try to drown out the noise of the carnage outside.\n\u201cI tried not to break in front of my wife and daughter, to try to hold myself together, but meanwhile the messages kept coming,\u201d Shamriz said.\nOne such message was from his brother, Alon, who lived alone, saying he was sitting quietly in his safe room before adding: \u201cI can hear them coming, tell everyone.\u201d\nShamriz said: \u201cI realised that I was talking to him maybe for the last time, so I wrote to him that I love him and that he\u2019s strong, and he sent me a love heart emoji. This was the last time we spoke.\u201d\nAs he walked around the hotel, Shamriz spotted a family who the IDF did not rescue for more than 30 hours because their house was so badly burned they assumed they were dead. He also pointed out a bullet-holed Liverpool FC poster in the hotel bar recently retrieved from the bedroom of one of the kibbutz\u2019s residents who was abducted along with his twin brother.\nAt another hotel 15 miles south in Tel Aviv, other families from Kfar Aza had their own devastating stories to tell.\nVarda and David Goldstein, both 73, were on holiday in Bulgaria with others from the kibbutz when they found out about the Hamas attacks in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage.\nThey quickly returned home and learned that their son, Nadav Goldstein Almog, a triathlete, and his oldest daughter, Yam, 20, had been murdered. Nadav\u2019s wife, Chen, 49, and their three younger children, Tal, nine, Gal, 11, and Agam, 17, had been taken hostage.\nView image in fullscreen The Goldstein Almog family, from left to right: Agam, Gal, Nadav, Chen, Tal and Yam.\n\u201cWhen we landed we had to go to straight to the police station to give DNA samples and then we came here,\u201d Varda Goldstein said in the hotel lobby.\nOmri Almog, Chen\u2019s brother, said his sister\u2019s home was riddled with bullet holes and blood stains. \u201cThey shot Nadav in the safe room, and Yam \u2013 she probably tried to run away or to do something, we don\u2019t know \u2013 but they shot her next to the door.\u201d\nNadav\u2019s parents\u2019 home was completely burned in the carnage. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a home to go back to,\u201d his mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only my house. It\u2019s all the community. So maybe it will take two years until we can go back to our community, to our house, to our kibbutz. And until then, we are like refugees in our land, with just two bags and two T-shirts.\u201d\nView image in fullscreen Omri Almog and Varda Goldstein are staying in a hotel in Tel Aviv.\nShe has dreams of retuning to Kfar Aza, but said: \u201cWe will do it as long as I know that there will be no shooting from the Gaza Strip back to us.\u201d\nShamriz returned to the kibbutz recently to take in the scene of his brother\u2019s abduction. \u201cIt was very hard,\u201d he said. \u201cYou realise that you have nowhere to go back to. I lived there for 30 years, most of my life, so this was the place that I called home. So if I won\u2019t be able to go to my home I don\u2019t really care where I live because nothing will feel like home and I will never go back to Kfar Aza.\u201d\nAzerad, the civil servant, was hopeful that eventually people would return to their homes. But she acknowledged it would cost billions of shekels to rebuild the communities and earn the public\u2019s trust.\n\u201cThe concrete is the easy part. The state has already started mapping the houses and sealing the houses so the winter will not harm them, and we\u2019re already talking about budgets to rebuild the houses. But I\u2019m talking about the feeling of being safe. I want to sleep in my bed without my daughter beside me because I\u2019m frightened,\u201d she said.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018I\u2019ll never go back\u2019: the Israelis displaced from homes by Hamas attack", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/21/israelis-displaced-from-homes-hamas-attack"}
