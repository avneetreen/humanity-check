Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, published preliminary conclusions Sunday in an ongoing investigation, based on video evidence and witness testimonies, into two strikes that killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and wounded six journalists from Reuters, AFP and Al Jazeera as they were covering clashes on the southern Lebanese border on 13 October. The head of RSF\u2019s Middle East desk, Jonathan Dagher, said there is not enough evidence at this stage to say the group was targeted specifically because they were journalists. However, the report noted that the journalists wore helmets and vests marked \u201cpress,\u201d as was the vehicle, and cited the surviving journalists as saying that they had been standing in clear view for an hour and saw an Israeli Apache helicopter flying over them before the strikes. The first strike killed Abdallah, and the second hit a vehicle belonging to an Al Jazeera team, injuring journalists standing next to it. Both came from the direction of the Israeli border, the report said, but it did not explicitly name Israel as being responsible. \u201cWhat we can prove with facts, with evidence for the moment, is that the location where the journalists were standing was explicitly targeted...and they were clearly identifiable as journalists,\u201d Dagher told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cIt shows that the killing of Issam Abdallah was not an accident.\u201d\n31 Oct 2023 03.27 CET Japan has imposed a fresh set of sanctions on individuals and a company connected to the Gaza-based militant group Hamas, according to a statement released by the Japanese foreign ministry on Tuesday.\nThe sanctions consist of freezing the assets of individuals and a company that have helped fund Hamas, and is in line with new sanctions announced by the United States government earlier this month.\nIt is the first set of sanctions Japan has imposed on Hamas since 7 October.\nIndividuals including Hamas operatives Muhammad Ahmad \u2018Abd Al-Dayim Nasrallah and Ayman Nofal were newly added to the list of people and organisations deemed as terrorists by Japan.\n31 Oct 2023 02.45 CET Hamas claims it is 'firing machine guns and anti-tank missiles' towards Israeli forces in Gaza Reuters: Hamas said its militants fired machine guns and anti-tank missiles toward Israeli forces in north and south Gaza early on Tuesday as Israel\u2019s tanks and infantry attacked the enclave\u2019s main city, raising concerns about the plight of Palestinian civilians.\nIsrael has expanded ground operations in Gaza as it seeks to punish Hamas for a deadly gun rampage three weeks ago that Israeli authorities say killed over 1,400 people.\nWitnesses said Israeli forces targeted Gaza\u2019s main north-south road on Monday and attacked Gaza City from two directions.\nThe al-Qassam brigades, the armed wing of Gaza\u2019s ruling Hamas movement, said militants clashed early on Tuesday with Israeli forces \u201cinvading the southern Gaza axis, (including) with machine guns, and targeted four vehicles with al-Yassin 105 missiles,\u201d referring to locally produced anti-tank missiles.\nThe militants also targeted two Israeli tanks and bulldozers in northwest Gaza with the missiles, al-Qassam said.\nNeither Reuters nor the Guardian were able to confirm the reports of fighting.

In a sign of increasing US concern at the escalating Palestinian death toll, Thomas-Greenfield told the council Biden reiterated to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday \u201cthat while Israel has the right and responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism, it must do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Hamas operates within and under the cover of civilians areas creates an added burden for Israel, but it does not lessen its responsibility to distinguish between terrorists and innocent civilians,\u201d she stressed.\n31 Oct 2023 02.22 CET US House Republicans plan to give Israel $14.3bn by cutting IRS funds Republicans in the US House of Representatives on Monday introduced a plan to provide $14.3bn in aid to Israel by cutting funding for the Internal Revenue Service, setting up a showdown with Democrats who control the Senate. In one of the first major policy actions under new House speaker Mike Johnson, House Republicans unveiled a standalone supplemental spending bill only for Israel, despite Joe Biden\u2019s request for a $106bn package that would include aid for Israel, Ukraine and border security. Johnson, who voted against aid for Ukraine before he was elected House speaker last week, had said he wanted aid to Israel and Ukraine to be handled separately. He has said he wants more accountability for money that has been sent to the Kyiv government as it fights Russian invaders. \u201cIsrael is a separate matter,\u201d Johnson said in an interview on Fox News last week, describing his desire to \u201cbifurcate\u201d the Ukraine and Israel funding issues. Johnson has said bolstering support for Israel should top the US national security agenda in the aftermath of the 7 October attack by Hamas that killed more than 1,400 people and saw more than 200 others taken hostage. Democrats accused Republicans of stalling Congress\u2019 ability to help Israel by introducing a partisan bill.

Asked whether he supported a statement from six former prime ministers who called for an end to religious hatred amid rising tensions over Israel\u2019s response against Hamas in Gaza, Mr Albanese said his position had been clear.

According to UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, 33 trucks carrying water, food and medical supplies entered Gaza through Rafah on Sunday. Prior to the war, some 500 trucks carrying aid and other goods entered Gaza every day.\n30 Oct 2023 00.51 CET In this opinion piece, addiction and trauma specialist Diane Young gives some advice for how to stay informed about this conflict while looking after your mental health. The ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza has once again brought to the forefront the grim realities of war and its impact on innocent civilians. As we\u2019re flooded with images and stories of destruction, suffering, and loss, it\u2019s natural to feel a deep sense of sadness, empathy, helplessness and, of course, anger and dismay at what we are witnessing. Many are finding it increasingly challenging to balance their desire to stay informed with the emotional toll this crisis can take. Unfortunately, this can lead to secondary trauma. Secondary trauma, also known as vicarious trauma, is a phenomenon where individuals experience symptoms of trauma as a result of witnessing or hearing about traumatic events happening to others, even if they aren\u2019t directly involved. In the context of the Israel-Gaza crisis, secondary trauma can manifest as feelings of grief and extreme sadness, anxiety and depression, helplessness, and even physical symptoms like headaches or stomach aches. For those trying to stay informed, the distressing images and videos can take a toll on their mental and emotional wellbeing. The line between being an informed and empathic global citizen and subjecting oneself to secondary trauma can be quite thin, and many of us find it difficult to turn away from the images flashing on our screens. We are in a state of disbelief. So, how can you navigate this difficult terrain while staying informed without succumbing to secondary or vicarious trauma? Here are some strategies: Distressing images and videos can take a toll on our mental health. How can we stay informed without being traumatised? | Diane Young Read more\n30 Oct 2023 00.27 CET Patrick Wintour Lazzarini added that there is no place is safe in Gaza, and warned that a further breakdown of civil order in the territory would make it \u201cextremely difficult if not impossible\u201d to deliver more aid. \u201cMost of the people of Gaza felt abandoned. They feel the world is equating all of them to Hamas. This is dangerous \u2013 an entire population is being dehumanised. The atrocities of Hamas do not absolve the state of Israel from its obligations under international humanitarian law. Every war has rules and this one is no exception,\u201d he said.\nUpdated at 00.57 CET\n30 Oct 2023 00.16 CET 64 UNRWA staff among the thousands of people killed in Gaza Patrick Wintour Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general for the UN relief and works agency (UNRWA), has accused Israel of \u201ccollective punishment\u201d of the people of Gaza, and of forcing their displacement from the north of the territory to the south \u2013 where they are still not safe. More than 8,000 Palestinians have now been killed in Israel\u2019s attack, who Lazzarini said included 64 UNRWA staff. He said that a UN worker named Samir, as well Samir\u2019s wife and eight children, were killed just hours before the meeting. The Swiss-Italian official said: My UNRWA colleagues are the only glimmer of hope for the entire Gaza Strip \u2026 but they are running out of fuel, water, food and medicine and will soon be unable to operate Entire population of Gaza becoming \u2018dehumanised\u2019 says UN commissioner Read more\nUpdated at 02.20 CET\n30 Oct 2023 00.06 CET Entire population of Gaza becoming \u2018dehumanised\u2019 says UN commissioner Patrick Wintour The entire population of Gaza is becoming \u201cdehumanised\u201d the commissioner general for the main UN agency in Palestine has told the UN security council, adding that a ceasefire has become a matter of life and death for millions. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general for the UN relief and works agency (UNRWA) was one of three speakers to starkly describe the scale of the damage being inflicted on Gaza, as UN agencies piled pressure on the security council to set aside its divisions and back some form of immediate humanitarian ceasefire. The speakers detailed a breakdown in civil order, the loss of clean water and a death rate of children that matches the total number of children killed in conflict in the last four years. The debate called by the United Arab Emirates was intended to build on the momentum created by Friday\u2019s vote by the UN general assembly calling for a humanitarian truce, a vote seen as a way of shaming the superpowers to abandon their arguments for not backing a form of ceasefire. Four previous draft UN security council resolutions on the crisis have been vetoed either by Russia or the US. Efforts are now being made by the 10 elected members of the security council \u2013 including Brazil, the current security council president \u2013 to frame a resolution that the five permanent members would feel forced to adopt.\nUpdated at 00.56 CET\n30 Oct 2023 23.58 CET Israel\u2019s expansion of its ground operations in Gaza has complicated US efforts to secure the release of hostages being held in the Palestinian territory, according to a report. A senior US official told CNN on Monday that they believed the prospects of getting hostages out could be described as \u201c50/50\u201d. \u201cThe parameters are all there,\u201d the official said about a potential deal, but efforts to negotiate with Hamas have been slow, they said. A spokesperson for Qatar\u2019s foreign affairs ministry told the outlet that Israel\u2019s escalation on the ground is making the situation \u201cconsiderably more difficult\u201d. Ongoing talks involving Israel, Qatar, Egypt, the US and Hamas have centered on freeing hostages in exchange for prisoners being held by Israel, according to a source. They have also included getting Hamas to open the Rafah gates for dual nationals to get out of Gaza, they said.\nUpdated at 00.40 CET", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Hamas reports clashes with IDF - as it happened", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/oct/30/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-aid-trucks-enter-gaza-strikes-casualties-israel-targets-hit-syria-lebanon"}
