Residents, most of them elderly, received medical attention at the scene. Others took shelter in a nearby subway station.\nAs people were clearing up debris and broken glass in the neighbourhood, the hum of a fresh wave of drones could be heard nearby.\nResidents immediately began sealing up broken windows using tape and paper to keep out the cold late November winds.\n\u201cOur soldiers shot down most of the drones. Unfortunately, not all,\u201d Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on Telegram. \u201cBut we continue to work to strengthen our air defence and shoot down more,\u201d he said.\nIn addition to Kyiv, the Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and Kirovohrad regions were also targeted.\nThe attack was carried out on the morning of Holodomor Memorial Day which commemorates the deliberate famine in Soviet Ukraine that killed millions of Ukrainians between 1932 to 1933, and is marked on the fourth Saturday in November.\nMeanwhile, shelling killed one person and wounded three in the southern Kherson region, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Saturday. According to Prokudin, the region had been shelled 100 times over the previous 24 hours.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Kyiv hit by biggest Russian drone attack since war began", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/kyiv-drones-russia-ukraine-vitali-klitschko-b2453372.html"}
