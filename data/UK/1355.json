The US president called for increased aid to both countries, arguing it would safeguard \u201cAmerican security for generations\u201d.\nThe Republican bill was supported by most of the hard-right faction that promoted Johnson\u2019s elevation to the House speakership last week. The Florida congressman, Matt Gaetz, one of Johnson\u2019s most vocal backers, had tweeted earlier: \u201cIsrael is a land with a 4,000-year connection to our faith. Ukraine is a former Soviet state. These are not the same thing, and should be considered independently.\u201d\nBut the move came under concerted attack from Democrats and also put the new speaker at odds with many members of his own Republican conference, as well as the party\u2019s leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, who has backed Biden\u2019s aid plan, which includes $61bn for Ukraine, defense funding for US allies in the Indo-Pacific, and $14bn to shore up the southern border.\nThe Democratic Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said the Republican proposal had \u201cthe hard-right\u2019s fingerprints all over it\u201d.\nBut Johnson defended his bill on Tuesday, telling Fox News: \u201cIf you put this to the American people and weigh the two needs, I think they will say standing with Israel and protecting the innocent is a more immediate need than IRS agents,\u201d he said.\nBlinken \u2013 who was heckled several times by members of the Code Pink group protesting the administration\u2019s support for Israel and refusal to back a ceasefire in Gaza \u2013 linked aid to Israel and Ukraine to Iran, a country known to support Hamas and maintain an alliance with Russia.\n\u201cThe conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have clear links,\u201d he told senators. \u201cSince we cut off Russia\u2019s traditional means of supplying its military, it\u2019s turned more and more to Iran for assistance. In return, Moscow has supplied Iran with increasingly advanced military technology, which poses a threat to Israel\u2019s security. Allowing Russia to prevail with Iran\u2019s support will simply embolden both Moscow and Iran.\u201d\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.
