We\u2019ll resume our live coverage later today. Here\u2019s a roundup of the latest developments. And you can see all our Israel-Gaza war coverage here. Thanks for reading. The Israel Defense Forces said it shot and killed three hostages after mistakenly identifying them as a threat during fighting in Gaza City. The three were named as Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Fouad Al-Talalka, 25, and Alon Shamriz, 26.\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu mourned the accidental killings of the three Israeli hostages, saying on X (formerly Twitter): \u201cTogether with the entire people of Israel, I bow my head in deep sorrow and mourn the fall of three of our dear sons who were kidnapped.\u201d\nIsrael reopened an aid crossing into the Gaza Strip on Friday after earlier approving the \u201ctemporary measure\u201d. Netanyahu\u2019s office said after weeks of pressure that the aid would be allowed to be delivered directly to Gaza through its Kerem Shalom border crossing.\nTwo of the world\u2019s largest shipping firms, Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, have said they are suspending passage through a Red Sea strait vital for global commerce after Yemeni rebel attacks in the area. The Iran-backed Houthis, who control much of Yemen but are not recognised internationally, say they are targeting shipping to pressure Israel during its war in Gaza.\nThe US should back the UN security council\u2019s action to protect Gaza\u2019s civilians, Human Rights Watch has said. HRW\u2019s UN director, Louis Charbonneau, said on Friday that the US should act at the UN security council to \u201cpressure Israel, as well as Palestinian armed groups, to comply with international humanitarian law and protect civilians\u201d.\nAl Jazeera says its journalist Samer Abudaqa was killed in an Israeli missile attack on Friday. It reports that Abudaqa was working alongside its bureau chief, Wael Al-Dahdouh, and both were reporting at Farhana school in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, when they were attacked by Israeli missiles. It said Abudaqa was trapped in the school for hours and unable to be reached by paramedics due to heavy Israeli shelling around the area.\nThe German airline carrier Lufthansa has said it will resume flights to Tel Aviv starting 8 January. In a statement released on Friday, Lufthansa said: \u201cIn a first phase, Lufthansa Airlines will initially offer four weekly flights from Frankfurt and three weekly flights from Munich. Austrian Airlines is planning eight weekly connections and SWISS five weekly flights.\u201d\nIn his address at the Global Refugee Forum, Philippe Lazzarini, chief of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said that what continues to shock him is the \u201cever increasing level of dehumanization\u201d with the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. He said: \u201cThe fact that people can laugh, cheer and mock any type of wrongdoing that we observe in this war, when in fact what is happening in Gaza should outrage anyone, should make us all rethink our values\u2026 This is also a make or break moment for all of us and for our shared humanity.\u201d\nUpdated at 03.46 CET\n16 Dec 2023 03.15 CET Israel reopens aid crossing on Gaza border Israel reopened an aid crossing into the Gaza Strip on Friday after earlier approving the \u201ctemporary measure\u201d. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said after weeks of pressure that the aid would be allowed to be delivered directly to Gaza through its Kerem Shalom border crossing, Agence France-Presse reports. Before Friday\u2019s reopening, all aid entering the Palestinian territory had to pass through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt.

Photograph: Cogat/X/Reuters The UN has said the amount of aid reaching Gaza has been well below the 500 truckloads a day that entered before October 7. A UN official said hunger and desperation were driving people to seize the limited aid that is arriving. UN aid chief Martin Griffiths earlier welcomed Israel\u2019s decision to open the Kerem Shalom crossing, saying on X (formerly Twitter) that it would increase the flow of aid. But what the people in Gaza need most is an end to this war.\nUpdated at 03.19 CET\n16 Dec 2023 02.50 CET Shipping companies suspend Red Sea traffic after Houthi attacks Two of the world\u2019s largest shipping firms, Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, have said they are suspending passage through a Red Sea strait vital for global commerce after Yemeni rebel attacks in the area. The Iran-backed Houthis, who control much of Yemen but are not recognised internationally, say they are targeting shipping to pressure Israel during its war with Hamas in Gaza, Agence France-Presse reports. The maritime tensions have added to fears that the Gaza conflict could spread. German transport company Hapag-Lloyd said on Friday it was halting \u201call container ship traffic across the Red Sea until Monday\u201d, after the Houthis attacked one of its vessels.

Photograph: Khaled Ziad/AFP/Getty Images The Danish firm Maersk made a similar announcement a little earlier. It said: We have instructed all Maersk vessels in the area bound to pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait to pause their journey until further notice. Maersk said that followed a \u201cnear-miss incident involving Maersk Gibraltar yesterday\u201d as well as Friday\u2019s attack, in which the rebels struck a Hapag-Lloyd cargo ship in the Red Sea.\nUpdated at 03.47 CET\n16 Dec 2023 02.20 CET Further to the protest in Tel Aviv, the Times of Israel has reported that anger among hostages\u2019 families has mounted in recent days after reports that the Israeli government has been holding off on initiating a hostage deal proposal with Hamas on the grounds that it believes that only continued military operations in Gaza will \u201cbring the terror group to its knees and back to the table with an offer Israel could accept\u201d. The report continues: Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly barred Mossad chief David Barnea from travelling to Qatar for that reason earlier this week. However, Axios reports that Netanyahu has since changed his mind and has agreed to dispatch Barnea to meet Qatari prime minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in Europe this weekend to discuss resuming negotiations toward another hostage deal. At the Tel Aviv protest, in which large crowds blocked off a road to traffic as they marched towards the Israel Defence Forces\u2019 Kirya military headquarters, the Times said the crowd was heard chanting: Their time is running out! Bring them home now! There is no victory until every last hostage is released! The IDF announced earlier that its troops shot and killed three hostages being held by Hamas after mistakenly identifying them as a threat during fighting in Gaza City.\nUpdated at 02.23 CET\n16 Dec 2023 01.38 CET Hundreds of protesters have blocked a major Tel Aviv intersection after the Israeli military said it accidentally killed three hostages in Gaza, Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper is reporting. The protesters are demonstrating in front of the Kirya military base, it said.

In a statement released on Friday, Lufthansa said: \u201cIn a first phase, Lufthansa Airlines will initially offer four weekly flights from Frankfurt and three weekly flights from Munich.

The Guardian\u2019s Kari Paul reports: Warren cited a statement co-signed by more than 90 human rights and civil rights organizations and listed various media reports and concerns about Meta\u2019s censorship, removal and mistranslation of Palestine-related content since Hamas attacks on Israel escalated conflict there in October. \u201cAmidst the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel, a humanitarian catastrophe including the deaths of thousands of civilians in Gaza, and the killing of dozens of journalists, it is more important than ever that social media platforms do not censor truthful and legitimate content, particularly as people around the world turn to online communities to share and find information about developments in the region,\u201d Warren said in the letter, first published by the Intercept. Hundreds of users have reported that posts on Instagram related to Palestine were limited or removed with little explanation, while others have found their accounts entirely suspended. Meta previously attributed these removals to glitches in its systems, but an independent analysis commissioned by the company in 2021 found that it had previously violated Palestinian human rights by censoring content related to previous Israeli attacks on Gaza.

Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images\n15 Dec 2023 23.59 CET US urged to back UN security council to protect civilians in Gaza The US should back the UN security council\u2019s action to protect Gaza\u2019s civilians, Human Rights Watch has said. HRW\u2019s UN director, Louis Charbonneau, said on Friday that the US should act at the UN security council to \u201cpressure Israel, as well as Palestinian armed groups, to comply with international humanitarian law and protect civilians\u201d. Charbonneau added that the US should also support calls to restore essential services to Gaza and allow humanitarian aid to reach all those in need. He went on to criticize what he called the US\u2019s \u201cdouble standards\u201d, saying: The US voting record at the UN has highlighted double standards in Washington\u2019s commitment to the laws of war. While blocking two security council resolutions in October and December, the US abstained from a November vote on a resolution focused on the plight of children in Gaza, which enabled it to pass. All three security council resolutions \u2013 the two that were vetoed and the one adopted \u2013 called on Israel to protect civilians and allow aid into Gaza and on Palestinian armed groups to release civilians held hostage. The one that passed is legally binding but Israel and Palestinian armed groups have defied it. He added: No permanent security council member \u2013 not the US, not Russia \u2013 should veto resolutions aimed at stopping mass atrocities.\nUpdated at 00.22 CET\n15 Dec 2023 23.37 CET The third Israeli hostage who was mistakenly killed by the Israel Defense Forces has been identified.

This is an unbearable tragedy. The entire state of Israel will mourn this evening. My heart goes out to the grieving families in their difficult time. I strengthen our brave warriors who penetrate the sacred mission of returning our abducted, even at the cost of their lives.

The Guardian\u2019s Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports: The US\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s bombing campaign in Gaza is facing new scrutiny in Washington following a proposed resolution by the independent senator Bernie Sanders that could ultimately be used to curtail military assistance. It is far from clear whether Sanders has the support to pass the resolution, but its introduction in the Senate this week \u2013 by an important progressive ally of the US president, Joe Biden \u2013 highlights mounting human rights and political concerns by Democrats on Capitol Hill. Citing the killing of nearly 19,000 people and wounding of more than 50,000 in Gaza since Hamas\u2019s brutal 7 October attack, Sanders said it was time to force a debate on the bombing that has been carried out by the rightwing government of the Israel prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the US government\u2019s \u201ccomplicity\u201d in the war.

The Network holds Israel accountable for systematically targeting and killing Al Jazeera journalists and their families. In today\u2019s bombing in Khan Younis, Israeli drones fired missiles at a school where civilians sought refuge, resulting in indiscriminate casualties. Following Samer\u2019s injury, he was left to bleed to death for over 5 hours, as Israeli forces prevented ambulances and rescue workers from reaching him, denying the much-needed emergency treatment. Al Jazeera Media Network extends its sincere condolences to the family in Gaza and in Belgium of the late colleague Samer Abudaqa. With the killing of Samer Abudaqa number of journalists and media workers killed in Gaza reached over 90. Al Jazeera urges the international community, media freedom organisations, and the International Criminal Court to take immediate action to hold the Israeli government and military accountable for these acts of carnage and crimes against humanity.
