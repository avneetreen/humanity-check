Kirby said that the US still opposes a ceasefire, believing that such a move would help Hamas militants. \u201cWe do support humanitarian pauses, as I said, to try to get hostages out and more aid in, but we don\u2019t support a ceasefire at this time,\u201d Kirby said during a news briefing on Friday. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember that there was ceasefire in place on 6 October,\u201d Kirby added.\nUpdated at 21.40 CET\n20 Jan 2024 02.51 CET Here\u2019s more on the White House saying Israel will allow shipments of flour for Palestinians through the Israeli port of Ashdod, north of Gaza. The move comes after the US president, Joe Biden, and Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke for the first time in nearly a month and follows the UN calling on Israel to allow access to the port for the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid for besieged Gaza, Agence France-Presse reports. Biden welcomed the Israeli decision on the port, the White House said, adding that US teams would \u201cseparately work on options for more direct maritime delivery of assistance into Gaza\u201d. Three UN agencies \u2013 the World Food Programme (WFP), Unicef and the World Health Organisation \u2013 pushed for the opening of Ashdod in a joint statement on Monday. The use of Ashdod, about 40km (25 miles) north of the Gaza border, was \u201ccritically needed by aid agencies\u201d, they said, while calling for a \u201cfundamental step change in the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza\u201d. The Israel-Hamas war has sparked a humanitarian catastrophe for Gaza\u2019s 2.4 million people, who are struggling to get food, water, fuel and medical care. Opening the Ashdod port would reduce the time it took to transport food from the north to Palestinians in Gaza, WFP\u2019s regional director for the Middle East, Corinne Fleischer, said this month.\n20 Jan 2024 02.19 CET Hezbollah warns Israel of 'slap in face' if cross-border strikes escalate A leader in the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has warned that Israel would \u201creceive a real slap in the face\u201d if it expanded the conflict along the Lebanon-Israel border. Since Hamas\u2019s deadly 7 October attack on Israel there have been near daily exchanges of cross-border fire between the Israeli army and Iran-backed Hezbollah, an ally of the Palestinian militants. Hezbollah\u2019s number two, Naim Qassem, said in a statement on Friday: If Israel decides to expand its aggression, it will receive a real slap in the face in response. Any restoration of stability on the border was contingent on \u201cthe end of the aggression in Gaza\u201d, he added, in comments reported by Agence France-Presse. The enemy must know the party is ready, that we are preparing based on the principle that an endless aggression can happen, just like our will to push back the aggression is infinite. His remarks came after Israeli airstrikes \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d at least three houses in southern Lebanon on Friday, the official Lebanese news agency NNA and the mayor of the affected border community said.

Photograph: Hasan Fneich/AFP/Getty Images The Israeli army said on Friday it had \u201cconducted air strikes and carried out artillery and tank fire against Hezbollah observation posts and terrorist infrastructure\u201d in the Kfar Kila sector. On Friday afternoon, Hezbollah claimed three attacks, including two against \u201cdeployments of soldiers of the Israeli enemy\u201d on the border, including using Burkan missiles, which can carry a large explosive payload. Since 7 October, Israel has repeatedly bombarded Lebanese border villages, with the violence killing more than 195 people in Lebanon, including at least 142 Hezbollah fighters, according to an AFP tally. On the Israeli side, 15 people have been killed, of whom nine were soldiers and six civilians, according to the Israeli army.\nUpdated at 03.24 CET\n20 Jan 2024 01.48 CET An American drone crashed north of Baghdad, a US defence official said, after Iran-backed militants claimed they fired on an unmanned aircraft flying over Iraq. \u201cA US UAV crashed near Balad airbase, Iraq\u201d on Thursday night local time, the official told Agence France-Presse, without identifying the type of drone that was lost. Iraqi security forces recovered the aircraft. There were no injuries reported. The official also said an investigation into the cause of the crash was under way. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-linked armed groups that oppose US support for Israel, said on Friday that it fired on a US MQ-9 \u2013 a type of drone that can be used for both surveillance and strikes - which was operating over Iraq the day before. \u201cMujahideen yesterday targeted... an MQ-9 drone belonging to the American occupation,\u201d the group said in a statement.

Photograph: James Lee Harper/US air force/AFP/Getty Images US and allied forces in Iraq and Syria have been hit by about 140 attacks since mid-October, according to the Pentagon \u2013 many of which have been claimed by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. Washington has carried out retaliatory strikes in both countries. On 4 January, a US strike in central Baghdad killed a pro-Iran commander who Washington said was involved in attacks on American troops \u2013 a move that infuriated the Iraqi government. The prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, whose government is backed by Tehran-aligned parties, has called for the US-led international coalition against the Islamic State jihadist group to depart the country.\nUpdated at 01.52 CET\n20 Jan 2024 01.11 CET Democrats urge US to reaffirm opposition to 'forced' Gaza displacements Dozens of President Joe Biden\u2019s fellow Democrats have signed a letter urging his administration to reaffirm that the US strongly opposes \u201cthe forced and permanent displacement\u201d of Palestinians from Gaza. The letter to the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, led by US representatives Ayanna Pressley and Jamie Raskin, was signed by 60 Democratic members of the House of Representatives, reflecting concern \u2013 especially on the left \u2013 over the steep toll on Palestinian civilians of Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas, Reuters reports. The letter said: We urge you to continue to reiterate the United States\u2019 firm commitment to this position and ask that you provide clarification regarding certain provisions of the administration\u2019s supplemental humanitarian and security funding request View image in fullscreen US representative Ayanna Pressley, who co-led the Democrats\u2019 letter to Antony Blinken. Photograph: Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters A State Department spokesperson said the department did not typically comment on congressional correspondence. But on the broader issue of displacement, the spokesperson said in an email: We have been clear. There must be no enduring forced displacement of Palestinians, whether inside of Gaza or outside. The spokesperson said the state department had rejected statements by some Israeli officials calling for resettlement of Palestinians outside of Gaza and understood from the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that was not the Israeli government\u2019s policy. Earlier, we reported that leading progressive and Jewish members of Congress have criticised the US\u2019s \u201cunconditional support\u201d for Israel after Netanyahu declared bluntly that he was opposed to a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza and directly rejected American policy.

It\u2019s just passed 2.10am in Gaza City and Tel Aviv\nUpdated at 02.27 CET\n19 Jan 2024 00.59 CET 16,000 women and children killed in Gaza, including two mothers every hour, says UN An estimated 16,000 women and children have been killed in Gaza since the war began, including about two mothers every hour, a UN agency has said. In a report released on Friday on \u201cThe Gendered Impact of the Crisis in Gaza,\u201d UN Women estimated that at least 3,000 women may have become widows and heads of households since 7 October. At least 10,000 children may have lost their father, it said. Of the territory\u2019s 2.3 million population, 1.9 million are displaced and \u201cclose to one million are women and girls\u201d seeking shelter and safety in a territory where no place is safe, it said. Sima Bahous, UN Women\u2019s executive director, said in a statement: We have seen evidenced once more that women and children are the first victims of conflict and that our duty to seek peace is a duty to them \u2026 That failure, and the generational trauma inflicted on the Palestinian people over these 100 days and counting, will haunt all of us for generations to come.\n19 Jan 2024 00.26 CET Jason Burke The blistering attack by Gadi Eisenkot, a senior minister in the Israeli war cabinet, on Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the campaign against Hamas was the latest sign of deep disagreement among political and military leaders over the direction of Israel\u2019s offensive. Eisenkot, a former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, said late on Thursday that only a ceasefire deal can win the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and that Israel was unlikely to achieve its aim of \u201ctotal victory\u201d over the militant Islamist group. Central to the disputes inside the war cabinet is the question of how to free the more than 130 hostages who remain in Gaza. Not all of them are believed to be alive and there is a growing sense in Israel that time is running out.

Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters The arguments are mirrored in wider Israeli society. Lilach Shoval in Israel Hayom, a rightwing newspaper, wrote: Fifteen weeks have elapsed since Hamas forced this war on Israel on that Black Saturday of October 7, and Israel remains far from achieving the goals it set for itself: toppling Hamas\u2019s military and governing ability, and returning the captives, not necessarily in that order. Others have described a \u201cquagmire\u201d. Mairav Zonszein, an Israel analyst with the International Crisis Group, said: There is no lack of support for the war but it is increasingly clear that the release of the hostages is in conflict with other goals. A poll published in Ma\u2019ariv newspaper found that if elections were held now, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party would be reduced to 16 of the 120 seats in the national assembly, the Knesset.\nUpdated at 00.36 CET\n19 Jan 2024 00.11 CET Here are some of the latest images from Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Yemen.

The US president said he spoke with the Israeli prime minister about possible solutions for creation of an independent state for Palestinians, noting that not all countries have their own militaries. Asked if he would reconsider conditions on US military aid to Israel given Netanyahu\u2019s comments rejecting a two-state solution, Biden said: I think we\u2019ll be able to work something out ... I think there\u2019s ways in which this could work. Asked if he believed Netanyahu would ever support a two-state solution, Biden replied \u201cYes, given the right one,\u201d a CNN reporter said. Reporters asked President Joe Biden at the White House if he believed Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu would ever support two-state solution.\n\"Yes, given the right one,\" Biden told @albamonica.\nI asked if he thought he'd be able to convince Netanyahu-- he told me, \"Yes.\" pic.twitter.com/pBKQrPCG6I \u2014 DJ Judd (@DJJudd) January 19, 2024", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "US says it conducted strikes against three Houthi missiles - as it happened", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/jan/19/middle-east-crisis-live-news-updates-israel-gaza-war-houthi-rebels-yemen-russia-china-ships-red-sea-crisis-attacks"}
