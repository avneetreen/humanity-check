The larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, agreed a peace deal with the government in 2016, but the ELN still has about 2,000 to 4,000 fighters in Colombia and neighboring Venezuela.\nELN leader Garc\u00eda wrote that public funding for the cease-fire should be \u201clinked\u201d to the suspension of kidnappings.\n\u201cPeace is not designed for just one side to win,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEveryone must benefit, especially the country.\u201d\nGarc\u00eda's announcement marks a setback for Colombia's first leftist government, which had described the tentative agreement by the ELN to stop kidnappings as an important step towards peace.\nThe current talks between both sides began in November of 2022. While they produced a six-month cease-fire that ends on Jan. 30, there has been little progress on other fronts.\nIn October Colombian officials pressured the ELN to stop kidnapping civilians for ransom after one of its squadrons shocked the nation, by abducting the parents of soccer star Luis D\u00edaz near their home in the north of the country.\nD\u00edaz's mother was quickly rescued by police, while his father was released 12 days later, after multiple protests and mediation efforts.\nBut Garc\u00eda warned the group would not be forced into giving up kidnappings.\n\u201cWe have not come to an agreement in the peace talks, on political, judicial or economic detentions\u201d he said in a message posted on X, formerly Twitter.\nColombia's Defense Ministry says the group is holding at least 38 hostages.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Colombia's ELN rebels say they will only stop kidnappings for ransom if government funds cease-fire", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/eln-ap-colombia-bogota-luis-diaz-b2469683.html"}
