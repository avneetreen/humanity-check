About 150 people in Lebanon have been killed, including 17 civilians, and 11 in Israel, including four civilians, with tens of thousands in both countries displaced from their homes.\nA report from Israel\u2019s Kan radio on Thursday, after a particularly intense rocket salvo hit the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, quoted a government source as saying that the parties were \u201capproaching the point when the chance of reaching an agreement that might guarantee that Hezbollah was distanced from the border would be exhausted \u2026 The sand in the diplomatic hourglass in Lebanon is running out.\u201d\nThose remarks followed comments by the foreign minister, Eli Cohen, after a trip to the north on Wednesday. He said: \u201cThere are only two options \u2013 a political solution or military operation. What existed prior to 7 October won\u2019t any more \u2026 We will grant a certain amount of time for a political solution. And if none is [reached], all options are on the table.\u201d\nAnother minister, Benny Gantz, said that the \u201csituation on Israel\u2019s northern border demands change.\n\u201cThe stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out; if the world and the Lebanese government don\u2019t act in order to prevent the firing on Israel\u2019s northern residents, and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will do it,\u201d he said at a media conference.\nMilitias allied with Tehran around the Middle East have launched drones and missiles towards Israel, disrupted international shipping in the Red Sea and attacked US military assets in the region in the wake of 7 October. Israel\u2019s retaliatory war on the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip has already become one of the most destructive conflicts of the 21st century, with estimates suggesting more than 21,000 people have been killed, 55,000 injured, and 85% of the territory\u2019s 2.3 million people forced to flee their homes.\nIsraeli tanks advanced deeper into the central Gaza Strip on Thursday as part of its widening offensive against Hamas, despite international calls for a ceasefire. Five days of relentless bombing of several overcrowded refugee camps near the central town of Deir al-Balah \u2013 all areas the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war \u2013 have led thousands more families to flee into Deir al-Balah town, setting up tents wherever there is space.\nView image in fullscreen Search and rescue efforts in Deir al Balah, after an Israeli attack on the Nuseirat refugee camp destroyed residential buildings.

Palestinian health authorities said 20 people were killed in the Khan Younis attack, and 210 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours.\nThe US has deployed military reinforcements in the region to deter further attacks on Israel, including the presence of aircraft carriers. But the longer the war in Gaza lasts, the greater the risk of miscalculation and regional escalation, which the Biden administration fears could draw in Iran. Earlier this week, Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, described the country as already engaged in a \u201cmulti-front war\u201d.\nWashington and Paris are leading intense secret negotiations to de-escalate the hostilities on the blue line, which are believed to include the possibility of finally resolving disputed territory on the border and persuading Hezbollah to withdraw its forces north of the Litani river, about 35km away.\nThe move would be in accordance with a UN resolution from the last war in 2006. Hezbollah, however, draws much of its grassroots support from the southern towns and villages closest to Israel, which were occupied for the better part of two decades before Israel withdrew its forces in 2000, and it is unlikely to willingly concede its raison d\u2019etre \u2013 resistance against Israel.\n\u201cIt is unlikely that any side wants it now, but war in Lebanon can happen any day if one sides misreads an action of the other,\u201d a senior European diplomat in the region said. \u201cThe biggest risk is that Netanyahu will intentionally start it to stay in power after the Gaza war goes down to a [less intense] level, knowing that he will be out of a job the day after,\u201d they added, referring to the Israeli prime minister.\nSince the bloody summer war in 2006 that left swathes of Beirut, the Lebanese capital, in ruins, both parties have been careful to avoid a return to full-scale conflict. Israel has not fought a two-front war since a surprise attack on Yom Kippur by Syria from the north and Egypt from the south 50 years ago.\nGallant and others in the war cabinet argued for a pre-emptive strike against the militant group in the immediate aftermath of the 7 October attack, a proposal that the US succeeded in quashing. But the conviction that a new war in Lebanon is inevitable appears to have taken hold among Israeli politicians, generals and a widening slice of the public: an opinion poll carried out in late November found that 52% of those surveyed favoured an immediate strike against Hezbollah, and only 35% were opposed to opening another front in the north.\n\u201cNasrallah needs to understand that he is next in line,\u201d Cohen said, referring to Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah\u2019s secretary general. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want this, he needs to force Hezbollah back to north of the Litani. All solutions are before us to bring our residents safely home.\u201d\nDespite growing divisions over the war\u2019s conduct with the US, Israel\u2019s most important ally, Israeli officials have said that Israel will push on until \u201ccomplete victory\u201d over Hamas. That goal, however, seems to be slipping further away, given the army\u2019s inability to capture or kill Hamas\u2019s leaders and in the face of fierce guerilla resistance in areas ostensibly under the army\u2019s control. Israel\u2019s military chief said this week that the war would last many more months, and ceasefire talks mediated by Qatar and Egypt appear to have stalled.\nMaha Rafiq, a 46-year-old mother of five from the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, said that she and her family had stopped thinking about when the war would end and were focused on day-to-day survival.\n\u201cWe sleep and wake up to the incessant sounds of shells and gunfire. Every day, my husband and I venture out to search for food, uncertain if we will see each other again. In the market, we struggle to find even the simplest things and they are double the normal price. I have four daughters who need sanitary pads, but we cannot find them,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where we will go if the ground invasion comes here. We focus on how to stay alive, searching for shelter and moving from place to place.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Israel says time running out to reach diplomatic solution in Lebanon", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/28/israel-says-time-running-out-to-reach-diplomatic-solution-with-lebanon"}
