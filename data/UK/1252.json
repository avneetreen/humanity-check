'Gaza is the largest terrorist base ever built.'\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tonight vowed that Israel 'will not stop' its war on the terrorist group and that the IDF is 'increasing pressure on Hamas every hour' as it encircles and infiltrates Gaza City for the first time in decades.\n'Hamas is now discovering we are coming into places they never thought we would,' he said at a press conference, adding that terrorist headquarters, tunnels and bases have been 'destroyed'.\nIsraeli forces have pushed further into the besieged enclave, which has been bombarded by airstrikes for weeks, and engaged Hamas fighters near the Shifa Hospital, it was earlier reported.\nThe IDF claims the hospital sits on top of the terror group's headquarters, and accuses Hamas's leaders of using it as a civilian shield against Israeli strikes.\nSmoke rises following Israeli strikes, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, in Gaza City, November 7, 2023\nIDF soldiers from the 14th Brigade, that includes tank battalion, infantry soldiers and Combat engineers. inside the northern part of Gaza strip\nWar cabinet minister Yoav Gallant said in a televised statement that the Hamas leader 'is hiding in his bunker and is without contact with his associates'\nHamas's Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar (pictured) has been 'isolated' in his bunker, Israel's defence minister said tonight\nIsraeli forces have pushed further into Gaza and engaged Hamas fighters near the Shifa Hospital, is have been reported.

Residents escaping the north of Gaza said they passed tanks in position to possibly storming it.\nIsrael says its forces have surrounded Gaza City, home to a third of the enclave's 2.3 million people, and are poised to storm it soon in their campaign to annihilate the Hamas terrorists who attacked Israeli towns exactly a month ago.\nThe IDF wrote on its Arabic language Telegram channel: 'For your safety, take this next opportunity to move south beyond Wadi Gaza.\n'If you care about yourself and your loved ones, head south according to our instructions. Rest assured that Hamas leaders have already taken care of defending themselves.'\nRear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the IDF killed several Hamas field commanders in airstrikes and operations overnight which aimed to 'significantly harms Hamas's ability to carry out counterattacks' - signalling the assault is drawing nearer.\nHe also said Israeli combat engineers were working to demolish each and ever tunnel they came across using 'different and diverse devices.'\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant, meanwhile, praised the efforts of the IDF's operations in the coastal strip in the past 24 hours as being 'very impressive.'\nThe aftermath of an Israeli bombardment in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, November 7\nAn aerial view shows the compound of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on November 7. The IDF claims the hospital sits on top of the terror group's headquarters, and accuses Hamas's leaders of using it as a civilian shield against Israeli strikes\n'The combination between the air force and ground forces shakes the Gaza Strip,' Gallant said in a video statement. On the Hamas field commanders killed in air strikes, he added: 'some of them were the ones we eliminated a day or two ago and they were replaced by others, and they were also eliminated.'\n\u2018They are manoeuvring on foot [and are using] armoured vehicles and tanks, along with military engineers from all directions, and they have one target \u2013 Hamas terrorists in Gaza, their infrastructure, their commanders, bunkers, communication rooms.\n\u2018They are tightening the noose around Gaza City.\u2019\nTop IDF commanders have compared Sinwar, Hamas' leader, to Bin Laden for his role in the group's atrocities.\nLieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht said: 'Yahya Sinwar is the face of evil. He is the mastermind behind this, like Bin Laden was [with the 9/11 US attacks].'\nWith international criticism of Israel's conduct of the war mounting, the Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll from Israel's bombardment of the territory - launched in response to the October 7 attack - surged past 10,000 people yesterday.\nMore than 1.5 million people in densely packed Gaza have fled their homes for other parts of the territory in a desperate search for cover, with critical aid only trickling in.\nLast night, Netanyahu told ABC News the war would continue until Israel had restored 'overall security' control of Gaza, adding that Gaza should be governed by 'those who don't want to continue the way of Hamas'.\n'Israel will, for an indefinite period, have the overall security responsibility,' he said.

I suppose we'll check the circumstances in order to enable goods - humanitarian goods - to come in or our hostages, individual hostages, to leave,' he added.\n'But I don't think there's going to be a general ceasefire. It will hamper the war effort, it will hamper our effort to get our hostages out, because the only thing that works on these criminals in Hamas is the military pressure we're exerting.'\nIn its October 7 attack, Hamas gunmen took more than 240 people hostage, including children and elderly people, into Gaza. The attack that prompted Israel's massive bombardment of Gaza and an intensifying ground offensive.\nAsked if there would be a pause if Hamas agrees to release the hostages, Netanyahu said 'there would be a ceasefire for that purpose, and we're waiting for that to happen. It hasn't happened so far.'\nAsked if Israel knows where the hostages are inside Gaza, the PM said while the country has some intelligence, 'I'm not sure its wise to share it here with Hamas.'\nNetanyahu's comments came after the White House said the Israeli leader had discussed potential 'tactical pauses' in a phone call with US President Joe Biden.\nHowever, no agreements were announced and the pair did not broach the possibility of a ceasefire, according to reports.\nOn his conversation with Biden, Netanyahu expressed his gratitude for the support of the United States, adding on the question of a ceasefire: 'The president himself said a ceasefire would be a surrender to Hamas, it would be a victory for Hamas.\n'You would no more have it than you would a ceasefire after the Al-Qaeda bombings of the World Trade Centre,' he added, referring to the September 11, 2001 attacks.\nOne month since the war began, the Hamas-run health ministry said the death toll in Gaza had surpassed 10,000 people - more than 4,000 of them children.\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Gaza was becoming a 'graveyard for children'.\nIsraeli soldiers take part in ground operations at a location given as Gaza in this handout photo released by the IDF on November 7\nAn Israeli tank is seen at a location inside Gaza on November 7 amid the on-going invasion\nAn Israeli soldier takes part in ground operations at a location given as Gaza in this handout photo released November 7\nAn Israeli soldier peers through a hole is a destroyed building somewhere in Gaza, November 7\nThe Israeli army said it had pounded Gaza with 'significant' strikes on 450 targets over 24 hours since Sunday morning, and that troops were targeting Hamas commanders in underground tunnels.\nIsraeli infantry and tanks have flooded the northern half of the Gaza Strip and tightened an encirclement of Gaza City, effectively splitting the territory in two.\nIsraeli troops who have taken up positions near the Gaza border told AFP they felt proud to protect their country but also nervous as the war intensifies.\nStationed near Gaza, a 20-year-old soldier said to the news agency he was 'a bit scared to go' into the Palestinian territory if given the order.\n'You don't know if you can come back alive,' said the soldier, whose name like those of other troops cannot be published because of Israeli military censorship.\nAround 30 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the offensive, the latest on Monday, according to a report from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), citing Israeli sources.\nAccording to the Hamas-run health ministry, Israel's latest overnight barrage killed 292 people and hit two paediatric hospitals and Gaza's only psychiatric hospital.\n'These are massacres!
