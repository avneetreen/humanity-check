John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council, has just been briefing reporters aboard Air Force One, and was asked about the allegations. Israel has previously denied it uses white phosphorus, which critics say put civilians at risk of serious and long-term injury, and is banned from use in civilian areas. On at least three occasions, 10, 11 and 16 October, Israel launched attacks in southern Lebanon, with Human Rights Watch posting links to video of \u201c155mm white phosphorus artillery projectiles being used, apparently as smokescreens, marking or signaling\u201d. Kirby said the Biden administration would be raising the new report with Israel\u2019s government: We\u2019ve seen the reports, we\u2019re certainly concerned about that. We\u2019ll be asking questions and trying to learn a little bit more. It\u2019s important to remind that white phosphorus does have a legitimate military utility in terms of illumination and reducing smoke to conceal movements. And obviously any time that we provide items like white phosphorus to another military, it is with full expectation that it\u2019ll be used for legitimate purposes and in keeping with the law of armed conflict.\nUpdated at 19.35 CET\n12 Dec 2023 02.21 CET Summary It\u2019s after 3:21am in Gaza and Tel Aviv and this blog is now closing. But first, here\u2019s a summary of the key moments today. Israel\u2019s defense minister Yoav Gallan on Monday said the next phase of the war in Gaza would be lower-intensity fighting against \u201cpockets of resistance\u201d and would require Israeli troops to maintain their freedom of operation, according to the Associated Press. \u201cThat\u2019s a sign the next phase has begun,\u201d he said. He\u2019s pushed back against international calls to wrap up the country\u2019s military offensive in the Gaza Strip, saying the current phase of the operation against the Hamas militant group will \u201ctake time.\u201d In a briefing with the Associated Press, Gallant refused to commit to any firm deadlines, but he signaled that the current phase, characterised by heavy ground fighting backed up by air power, could stretch on for weeks and that further military activity could continue for months.\nThe White House said it is \u201cconcerned\u201d over reports that Israel\u2019s military is using white phosphorus bombs against target in Lebanon. At a morning briefing, John Kirby , strategic communications coordinator for the national security council, said use of the highly incendiary substance could legally be used for a smokescreen to conceal military operations, but that the US would seek clarification from Israel about how stocks were being used.\nIsrael\u2019s defense minister Yoav Gallant gave a fleeting and noncommittal answer when asked at his Monday briefing about reports the country was using white phosphorus in military attacks. The Israeli Defense Forces operate \u201caccording to international law\u201d, he said.\nGallant also said Israel had \u201cno intention\u201d of staying permanently in Gaza after the completion of its military campaign to eliminate Hamas. The country was open to discuss alternatives about who will control the territory as long as it is not a group hostile to Israel, he said, and would consider an agreement with Hezbollah in Lebanon if security guarantees were received.\nIsrael will open the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza on Tuesday in an attempt to speed the security screening of humanitarian aid. A spokesperson for Cogat, the Israeli government department responsible for coordinating activities in the territories, said all aid will still enter via the Rafah crossing in Egypt, but the move to increase screening capacity will double the amount getting in.\nEuropean leaders Leo Varadkar of Ireland, Pedro Sanchez of Spain, Robert Abela of Malta and Alexander De Croo of Belgium, wrote to EU president Charles Michel calling for a discussion about a Gaza ceasefire at the union summit on 14 and 15 December. US network CNN said the letter expressed \u201calarm\u201d over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and questions Israel\u2019s military campaign and its effect on the civilian population.\nThe Hamas-run Gaza health ministry updated casualties since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October, stating that 18,205 Palestinians have been killed, and 49,645 injured. The reported death toll has risen by more than 500 in the two days from Saturday, when it stood at 17,700, the ministry said.\nQatar has spoken with Israel to gauge interest in talks about a possible new pause in the fighting in Gaza, according to a journalist for Axios. The report directly contradicts the position of diplomats at the annual Doha Forum conference in Qatar, who have said they are not expecting any reopening of Gaza ceasefire talks for some weeks.\nAt least 52 people were arrested in Washington DC on Monday at a protest calling for the US to push for a permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Activists representing the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, Jewish Voice for Peace and other groups briefly protested in a Senate office building before police ended the demonstration and took dozens into custody.\nItaly, France and Germany called on the European Union to impose ad hoc sanctions against Hamas and its supporters. \u201cWe express our full support for the \u2026 proposal to create an ad hoc sanctions regime against Hamas and its supporters,\u201d they said in a letter to the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell.\nFrance is also considering imposing national sanctions on those involved in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, the French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna , has said.\nFighting continued on the ground in the Gaza Strip, accompanied by repeated aerial bombardments from Israel. Rockets have also been fired into Israel from Gaza, and from anti-Israeli forces in Lebanon. Some of the heaviest close-quarters fighting in more than two months of conflict took place over the weekend, as the Israel Defense Forces tried to consolidate control of urban centres in northern Gaza and pursued Hamas leaders in the heart of the biggest city in the south, Khan Younis.\nHarvard University\u2019s governing board faced mounting pressure on Monday to publicly declare support for, or oust the university president, according to a report by Reuters. It follows remarks she made last week at a congressional hearing on antisemitism.\nIsrael told the UN that it \u201cmust do better\u201d at delivering aid to people in Gaza. The country said it was willing to double the number of inspections, but that \u201caid keeps waiting at the entrance of Rafah\u201d. Since 7 October Israel has essentially blockaded Gaza, including at times cutting off telecommunications. The Rafah crossing with Egypt is the only entrance or exit to Gaza that has been open with any regularity, and Israel insists on inspecting all cargo being sent into the territory\n12 Dec 2023 02.08 CET Read our piece on how the Palestinian Keffiyeh has become a global symbol, by Niloufar Haidari: Last month, three college students in Burlington, Vermont, were walking home after Thanksgiving \u2013 their second in the US, after applying to study abroad from their homes in the West Bank in 2021.

I got brief and temporary access to the internet, and I unintentionally saw videos and photos of horrible things Gazans are going through. They made me realise that death could be a merciful fate.
