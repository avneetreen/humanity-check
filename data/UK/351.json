That has given a boost to Ukraine\u2019s agriculture-dependent economy.\nThe mine incident occurred about 130 kilometers (80 miles) southwest of Chornomorsk, which is near Odesa on Ukraine\u2019s southern coast, the Ambrey maritime risk analysis company said. The ship with 18 crew was on its way to Izmail, another port in the area.\nThe mine detonated at the ship's stern, causing equipment and machinery failure and resulting in the vessel losing power, Ambrey said. The captain reportedly maneuvered into shallow water to prevent the ship from sinking.\nUkraine\u2019s much-anticipated counteroffensive last summer largely failed to shift the front line despite billions of dollars in weaponry sent by its Western allies. That has given confidence to the Kremlin\u2019s forces, especially as further Western aid is in question.\nOne think tank argues that the front line is not currently \u201ca stable stalemate.\" The Institute for the Study of War in Washington said in an assessment late Wednesday that \u201cthe current balance can be tipped in either direction by decisions made in the West or in Russia, and limited Russian gains could become significant especially if the West cuts off military aid to Ukraine.\u201d\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested that the U.S. and European Union countries plan to continue sending help to Kyiv.\n\u201cNeither Washington nor Brussels refrain from assisting the Kyiv regime (Ukrainian government) because they realize it would be doomed without such assistance,\u201d Lavrov said in an interview with state news agency Tass that was released on Thursday. \u201cThey remain committed to containing Russia at the expense of Ukrainians and their lives.\u201d\n___\nJim Heintz in Tallinn, Estonia contributed.\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "A cargo ship picking up Ukrainian grain hits a Russian floating mine in the Black Sea, officials say", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-washington-black-sea-danube-kyiv-b2470421.html"}
