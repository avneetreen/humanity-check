This Christmas Eve every shop and restaurant was closed.\nManger Square, next to the church of the Nativity, which was built on the spot where Jesus is believed to have been born, was grey and sad without decorations. For the first time in living memory there was no traditional Christmas tree at its centre.\nCelebrations in Bethlehem usually culminate with a parade and Catholic midnight mass on Christmas Eve at the church of St Catherine. Spaces are usually filled months in advance, but attendance was expected to be so low this year that the Franciscan order, which assigns tickets and deals with security for the event, scrapped the usual protocols. Instead, the prayer service was open to everyone.\nAfter a silent parade as the bishops and patriarchs of Jerusalem arrived in the city for the service, the pews were unexpectedly full inside the church. Palestinians of various faiths, and from many different areas, had traversed Israeli checkpoints to go to Bethlehem and pay their respects to Gaza\u2019s dead, and pray for the safety of the living.\nSome wore the black and white keffiyeh associated with Palestine. The atmosphere was hushed and sad.\nBefore the latest war broke out after the attack by Hamas on 7 October which killed 1,140 people, there were about 1,300 people in Gaza\u2019s tiny Christian community. Now that number is believed to be closer to 800.\nThe Catholic Holy Family church, in Gaza City, became a makeshift shelter but it has been repeatedly hit by Israeli airstrikes.\nLast week Pizzaballa said the Israeli army had placed the church under siege, and shot and killed two Christian women. Pope Francis condemned the attack, which the Israel Defense Forces denied knowledge of.\nThe pope also devoted his Christmas Day blessing in St Peter\u2019s Basilica, in the Vatican, to a call for peace in the world, noting that the biblical story of the birth of Christ in Bethlehem sent a message of peace \u2013 but that Bethlehem \u201cis a place of sorrow and silence\u201d this year.\nAt the Christmas Eve service in St Catherine\u2019s, Pizzaballa told the congregation that every December he sought permission from the Israeli authorities for a pastoral visit to Gaza. He reflected on the community\u2019s resilience and patience.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t abandon you,\u201d he said, addressing people in the Gaza Strip, who are facing a Christmas unlike any other.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "\u2018Sorrow and silence\u2019 in Bethlehem as Christmas festivities are cancelled", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/25/no-room-for-the-people-of-gaza-the-persecution-mirrors-that-of-jesus-birth-says-popes-patriarch"}
