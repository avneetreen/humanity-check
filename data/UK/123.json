Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s high representative, told reporters that Israel Katz had come to the meeting and presented two videos to the bloc\u2019s foreign ministers. One was for an artificial island off the coast of Gaza and another on a railway linking the Middle East to India. Borrell said: This didn\u2019t have much to do with what we were discussing. He added: I think the minister could have made better use of his time to worry about the security of his country and the high number of deaths in the Middle East and the high death toll in Gaza.

They said the video was \u201clargely ignored\u201d by foreign ministers and it was not clear whether Israel Katz meant it would be used to house Palestinians or just a new port facility, which he proposed back in 2017.
