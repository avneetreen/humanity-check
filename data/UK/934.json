In a statement following reports of the attack on his home, Reuters condemned the \u201cbaseless accusations\u201d from HonestReporting.\n\u201cThereafter, numerous threats against his safety circulated online. HonestReporting later accepted that its accusations were unfounded,\u201d according to Reuters.\n\u201cThe situation on the ground is dire, and the [Israel Defense Forces\u2019] unwillingness to give assurances about the safety of our staff threatens their ability to deliver news about this conflict without fear of being injured or killed,\u201d the statement added.\nDespite the spurious claims in the HonestReporting report, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office told news outlets that hired those journalists that they were \u201cparticipants in this horrifying event\u201d.\nIsrael\u2019s former defence minister Benny Gantz also suggested that if journalists knew of the attack beforehand, they are \u201cno different than terrorists and should be treated as such.\u201d Danny Danon, former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, promised to \u201chunt them down together with the terrorists.\u201d\nRepublican US Senator Tom Cotton also called on the US Department of Justice to investigate news outlets for \u201cfederal crimes by supporting Hamas terrorists.\u201d\nA letter from general counsel with The New York Times to Mr Cotton said his reliance on \u201cdisinformation\u201d and \u201cfalsehoods\u201d should \u201cnot be abused by a US senator to falsely accuse fellow Americans of crimes.\u201d\nThe company also issued a statement condemning \u201creckless\u201d allegations that are \u201cputting our journalists on the ground in Israel and Gaza at risk.\u201d\nMr Qudih told Reuters that the four strikes on his two-storey home in Khan Yunis in southern Gaza were seconds apart. He said roughly 20 people were inside during the strike, which left an impact crater in a yard behind the house and destroyed a side of the building.\nHis in-laws, two nieces aged 13 and eight, and an eight-year-old nephew were killed, according to a post shared on his Instagram profile.\nPhotojournalist Belal Khaled captured the burial of his family members.\nA statement from the IDF to Reuters declined to say whether the agency was responsible or whether Mr Qudih was a target.\n\u201cThe IDF is currently focused on eliminating the threat from the terrorist organization Hamas. Questions of this kind will be looked into in a later stage,\u201d IDF said in a statement to Reuters.\nPalestinian journalists carried mock coffins of journalists killed during the war at a symbolic funeral in the West Bank on 7 November. (AP)\nGaza\u2019s health ministry has reported more than 13,000 dead since 7 October, including more than 5,500 children. Israel\u2019s ongoing bombardments and military siege in Gaza have marked the deadliest period for journalists in more than 30 years.\nAt least 50 journalists, including 45 Palestinian media workers, have been killed in the aftermath of Hamas attacks last month, as of 20 November. At least four Israeli journalists and one Lebanese reporter also have been killed.\nAt least 11 journalists were injured, three journalists were reported missing, and 18 journalists were arrested, while Palestinian media workers have reported widespread threats and cyberattacks against them, and reported targeted killings of their family members, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\nBelal Jadallah, a prominent journalist in Gaza and the director of the nonprofit media group Press House Palestine, was killed and his pharmacist brother-in-law was seriously wounded during an Israeli attack on Sunday, according to his family.\nTor Wennesland, the United Nations\u2019 special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, said he was \u201cshocked and saddened to learn\u201d of the death of Jadallag, a \u201cprofessional, knowledgeable [and] passionate journalist who dedicated his life for the freedom of journalism [and] protection of journalists.\u201d\nThe Independent\u2019s request for comment to HonestReporting was directed to a statement from 12 November, in which the group said it \u201cstands behind the legitimate questions we raised to media outlets in our recent expos\u00e9.\u201d\n\u201cWe are proud of the role that we play in holding the media accountable. How journalists frame events in and about Israel affect the safety of Jews worldwide; so we will continue to ensure that anti-Israel bias in mainstream media is exposed,\u201d the statement reads.\n\u201cDespite HonestReporting\u2019s recent backpedaling, it\u2019s a virtual certainty that their irresponsible speculation will be cited to justify past and future violence against the press,\u201d Seth Stern, director of advocacy with the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told The Independent earlier this month.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve put journalists\u2019 lives at risk,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s disgraceful for politicians \u2026 to cite the spurious report to call for violence against journalists and baseless investigations of news outlets.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Airstrikes hit home of Gaza photojournalist targeted by pro-Israel media group", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-gaza-journalist-honestreporting-b2450776.html"}
