The world watched as he learnt that his wife, son, daughter and grandson had been killed in an Israeli air strike on 25 October.\nJust two months later, al-Dahdouh was hit by shrapnel while he was reporting from the scene of a bombarded school in Khan Younis. Weeks later, his other son, Hamza \u2013 also a journalist \u2013 was killed in an airstrike by Israeli forces.\nWael al-Dahdouh buries his son, who was killed in an Israeli strike (Getty)\nThe same group that have been singing together gather around al-Dahdouh as he buries his son with one hand gripping a press helmet. Despite his unimaginable losses, he has continued reporting, saying: \u201cAll the world needs to see what is happening here.\u201d\nAs Sunday marks the 100th day of the war, data from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) shows that more journalists have been killed in the first 10 weeks of the Israel-Hamas war than have ever been killed in a single country over an entire year.\nThe CPJ places the death toll at at least 82 \u2013 75 of them Palestinian, four Israeli, and three Lebanese. The four Israeli journalists were killed in the 7 October Hamas attacks that left more than 1,200 people dead. Among them was Yaniv Zohar, a former Associated Press videojournalist, who was killed along with his wife and two daughters.\nThe International Criminal Court has announced it is investigating alleged offences against Palestinian journalists since the Hamas attacks, after Paris-based NGO Reporters Without Borders (RSF) filed a second complaint in December. RSF described the targeting of journalists as \u201cintentional homicides of civilians\u201d.\nThe United Nations said Gaza has seemingly become the deadliest place in the world for journalists and their families, as it raised concerns once again following the killings of Hamza Dahdouh and Mustafa Thuraya, a freelance videographer working for Agence France-Presse.\n\u201cVery concerned by high death toll of media workers in Gaza,\u201d the UN rights office wrote on X, adding: \u201cKillings of all journalists, including Hamza Wael Dahdouh and Mustafa Abu Thuria in reported IDF strike on car must be thoroughly, independently investigated to ensure strict compliance with international law, and violations prosecuted.\u201d\nMotee\u2019 Masbhah says he feels obliged to continue reporting despite the danger posed (Supplied)\nEfforts to document the war are already being hindered by frequent communication blackouts and the refusal to allow journalists to rotate in and out of the Gaza Strip. Only a handful of international journalists have been permitted to enter Gaza with Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops.\nSpeaking from al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah, reporter Motee\u2019 Masbhah tells The Independent: \u201cNo journalist here knows if they will live until the evening.\n\u201cWe are under deliberate and intentional targeting by the occupation,\u201d he claims. \u201cIsrael wants to stop the Palestinian people from learning what is happening on the ground. It is blatant.\u201d\nIsrael has denied targeting journalists, and said it does everything it can to avoid harming civilians in its war on Hamas.\nReuters journalist Issam Abdallah was killed while stationed 1km from the northern Israeli border with Lebanon (Reuters)\nFollowing the strike on Hamza Dahdouh and Mustafa Thuria, Israel initially claimed that its forces had \u201cidentified and struck a terrorist who operated an aircraft that posed a threat to IDF troops\u201d.\n\u201cWe are aware of the reports that, during the strike, two other suspects who were in the same vehicle as the terrorist were also hit,\u201d it added. However, the Israeli military\u2019s chief spokesperson appeared to contradict this statement when he was asked by NBC to provide evidence to support the claims, as he responded: \u201cWe understand they were putting a drone, using a drone. And using a drone in a war zone, it\u2019s a problem. It looks like the terrorists.\u201d\nHe added that the incident would be investigated. The families of the journalists strongly rejected the claims. Al-Dahdouh\u2019s family told the BBC they were \u201cfabrications\u201d made to justify the targeting of journalists.\nAbeer (centre), the sister of Abdallah, weeps at his funeral (AP)\nRamy Abdu, the founder of non-profit organisation Euromed Monitor, paid tribute to Bilal Jadallah, the director of Press House-Palestine, who was killed when an airstrike hit his car on 19 November. His most recent work, for the CPJ, documented a deadly pattern of journalist killings by the IDF.\n\u201cNo foreign press got into Gaza without Bilal\u2019s help,\u201d Abdu says. \u201cBut he was killed without any word of condemnation from Europe. They forgot about him.\u201d\nJournalists documenting developments in the West Bank say they have also found themselves under threat while doing their job. Asif Nawfal, 28, describes dodging bullets as he and other journalists tried to cover settler attacks on the village of Deir Sharaf, west of Nablus, on 2 November.\nAbd Elkader Abd Elhalim, a Palestinian journalist based in Nazareth, calls the press climate \u201cmilitant\u201d as he describes a marked shift in his reporting.\nAsif Nawfal describes dodging bullets while reporting in the West Bank (Supplied)\n\u201cThe news I write is not at the same level that it used to be before, because we are afraid,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are not as courageous as the people of Gaza. We are afraid of being detained or arrested, while others are facing death to tell their stories.\n\u201cNo one should have to show this level of bravery. No one should have to go through this. They are doing what has never been done before.\n\u201cThe world chooses to see what they want, and chooses to ignore what they want. If these stats were coming out of any other country outside of the Middle East, you would find condemnations and unbelievable efforts to stop this.\u201d\nThe Israeli military has been contacted for comment.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Gaza journalists killed: The reporters risking their lives to cover the Israel-Hamas conflict in the deadliest modern war for journalists", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/gaza-palestine-israel-journalists-killed-b2468465.html"}
