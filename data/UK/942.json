He was reportedly arrested with more than 200 others at a checkpoint, then imprisoned and beaten, according to Ms Buttu.\nMr Toha is the author of the American Book Award-winning poetry collection Things You May Find Hidden in My Ear and the founder of Gaza\u2019s first English-language library. He was a visiting poet and librarian-in-resident at Harvard University in 2020.\nThings You May Find Hidden in My Ear also was named a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in Poetry and the 2022 Walcott Poetry Prize.\nNews outlets, his publishers, free expression groups and press freedom advocates urged his immediate release and protection following news of his disappearance.\nMr Toha was detained \u201cfor no evident reason\u201d and questioned somewhere outside Gaza in southern Israel, according to The New Yorker\u2019s web editor Michael Luo, who shared an update from the magazine\u2019s top editor David Remnick on social media on Tuesday.\nOn Monday, Mr Luo said Mr Remnick sent a note to staff about the \u201cworrisome news\u201d surrounding Mr Toha\u2019s disappearance, adding that the publication \u201clearned he was arrested in central Gaza.\u201d\nA spokesperson for The New Yorker on Monday directed The Independent to a statement on its website under the headline \u201cIsraeli Forces Reportedly Detain a New Yorker Contributor.\u201d\n\u201cIn an essay published here last month, he wrote about Israeli air strikes in his neighborhood. \u2018One idea in particular haunts me, and I cannot push it away,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018Will I, too, become a statistic on the news?\u2019 Over the weekend, Israeli forces reportedly detained Abu Toha in central Gaza. His whereabouts are now unknown,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe New Yorker joins other organizations in calling for his safe return.\u201d\nAn IDF spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment from The Independent and other news organisations. A statement from the agency on Tuesday claimed that its military intelligence indicated interactions among civilians and a terror group in Gaza. Mr Toha was arrested among those civilians, questioned and released, according to the IDF.\nMosab Abu Toha\u2019s poetry collection \u2018Things You May Find Hidden in My Ear\u2019 received a 2023 American Book Award. (Arrowsmith Press)\nMr Toha and his family sought refuge at the Jabalia refugee camp after his home was bombed. Earlier this month, The New Yorker published his account of the attacks at his home and his life inside the camp.\n\u201cI sit in my temporary house in the Jabalia camp, waiting for a ceasefire,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI feel like I am in a cage. I\u2019m being killed every day with my people. The only two things I can do are panic and breathe. There is no hope here.\u201d\nFree expression groups PEN America and PEN International called for Mr Toha\u2019s protection in the wake of his disappearance.\n\u201cWe are relieved and grateful at the news that poet Mosab Abu Toha has been released and will be reunited with his family,\u201d PEN America shared in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cPoets and writers must be free to speak truth without fear.\u201d\nJehad Abusalim, who co-edited the anthology Light in Gaza: Writings Born of Fire, which includes a chapter from Mr Toha, said his release is the \u201cdirect result of your relentless pressure, a force driven by both outrage and a deep sense of familiarity.\u201d\n\u201cOne may wonder why Israel would kidnap a poet,\u201d he wrote in an essay following news of his arrest. \u201cDespite the ongoing war and constant bombardment, Mosab\u2019s words have appeared in many US and international publications. His writings defy \u2013 and will continue to defy \u2013 the violence surrounding him.\u201d\nGaza\u2019s health ministry has reported more than 13,000 dead, including more than 5,500 children, following Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October that killed 1,200.\nThe weeks that followed during Israel\u2019s ongoing bombardments and military siege have also marked the deadliest period for journalists in more than 30 years. At least 53 media workers have been killed, including 46 Palestinian, four Israeli, and three Lebanese journalists, as of 21 November, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Palestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha released by IDF after abrupt arrest", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/mosab-abu-toha-arrest-release-b2451245.html"}
