But it later backtracked and said that using a drone made the journalist \u201clook like the terrorists\u201d, even though the camera drones are commonly used by media organisations.\nThe letter to Biden said that in other cases \u201cjournalists reported receiving threats from Israeli officials and IDF officers before their family members were killed in Gaza\u201d.\n\u201cOf course, the targeted or indiscriminate killing of journalists, if committed deliberately or recklessly, is a war crime, and the international criminal court has said that it will investigate reports of war crimes committed against journalists in Gaza,\u201d the letter said.\nThe letter noted the \u201clongstanding pattern of impunity in the killings of journalists by the IDF\u201d, including over the shooting death last year of the Al Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Akleh, a US citizen.\nIsraeli authorities falsely claimed Abu Akleh was killed by the Palestinians but then admitted it was \u201chighly probable\u201d she was killed by the IDF during a gun battle. Footage of the incident showed there was no such battle. A group of Democratic members of the US Senate said Abu Akleh may have been targeted by the Israeli army because she was a journalist.\nThe letter said Biden should use the US\u2019s record of strong support for Israel to pressure its government to abide by international humanitarian law.\n\u201cAs such, the United States will be judged on how it has used that influence to ensure that all parties to the conflict abide by international law. Integral to this is the protection of journalists, not only because journalists are civilians, but also because they play an indispensable role in documenting and reporting on war crimes and other human rights violations,\u201d it said.\n\u201cWe believe your administration can and must do more to effectively pursue accountability for journalists killed in the hostilities and to protect and support local and international journalists covering it.\u201d\nThe letter urged Biden to \u201cabjure the indiscriminate and deliberate killing of journalists, promptly and thoroughly investigate all attacks on journalists, and hold accountable individuals found to be responsible for them\u201d.\nThe groups also asked the president to pressure Israel to permit journalists to enter Gaza and report freely on the war after months of almost all foreign reporters being blocked from the Palestinian territory.\nIsrael often boasts it has a free press but the letter noted censorship restricting reporting on legitimate matters of public concern and threats by the government \u201cagainst the country\u2019s oldest newspaper, Haaretz, for its coverage of the war, and threatening to shut down local bureau offices of foreign news agencies\u201d.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Press freedom groups urge Biden to hold Israel accountable for killings of journalists", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/11/biden-israel-gaza-war-killing-reporters-press-freedom"}
