But the attacks, Neuberger said, offered a fresh warning that American companies and operators of critical infrastructure \u201care facing persistent and capable cyber attacks from hostile countries and criminals\u201d that are not going away.\n\u201cSome pretty basic practices would have made a big difference there,\u201d said Neuberger, who serves as a top adviser to President Joe Biden on cyber and emerging technology issues. \u201cWe need to be locking our digital doors. There are significant criminal threats, as well as capable countries \u2014 but particularly criminal threats \u2014 that are costing our economy a lot.\u201d\nThe hackers, who U.S. and Israeli officials said are tied to Tehran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, breached multiple organizations in several states including a small municipal water authority in the western Pennsylvania town of Aliquippa. The hackers said they were specifically targeting organizations that used programmable logic controllers made by the Israeli company Unitronics, commonly used by water and water treatment utilities.\nMatthew Mottes, the chairman of the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa, which discovered it had been hacked on Nov. 25, said that federal officials had told him the same group also breached four other utilities and an aquarium.\nThe Aliquippa hack prompted workers to temporarily halt pumping in a remote station that regulates water pressure for two nearby towns, leading crews to switch to manual operation.\nThe hacks, which authorities said began on Nov. 22, come as already fraught tensions between the U.S. and Iran have been heightened by the two-month-old Israel-Hamas war. The White House said that Tehran has supported Houthi rebels in Yemen who have carried out attacks on commercial vessels and have threatened U.S. warships in the Red Sea.\nIran is the chief sponsor of both Hamas, the militant group which controls Gaza, as well as the Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nThe U.S. has said they have uncovered no information that Iran was directly involved in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the massive retaliatory operation by Israeli Defense Forces in Gaza. But the Biden administration is increasingly voicing concern about Iran attempting to broaden the Israeli-Hamas conflict through proxy groups and publicly warned Tehran about the Houthi rebels' attacks.\n\u201cThey\u2019re the ones with their finger on the trigger,\u201d White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters earlier this week. \u201cBut that gun \u2014 the weapons here are being supplied by Iran. And Iran, we believe, is the ultimate party responsible for this.\u201d\nNeuberger declined to comment on whether the recent cyber attack by the Iranian hacker group could portend more hacks by Tehran on U.S. infrastructure and companies. Still, she said the moment underscored the need to step up cybersecurity efforts.\nThe Iranian \u201cCyber Av3ngers\u201d attack came after a federal appeals court decision in October prompted the EPA to rescind a rule that would have obliged U.S public water systems to include cybersecurity testing in their regular federally mandated audits. The rollback was triggered by a federal appeals court decision in a case brought by Missouri, Arkansas and Iowa, and joined by a water utility trade group.\nNeuberger said that measures spelled out in the scrapped rule to beef up cybersecurity for water systems could have \"identified vulnerabilities that were targeted in recent weeks.\u201d\nThe administration, earlier this year, unveiled a wide-ranging cybersecurity plan that called for bolstering protections on critical sectors and making software companies legally liable when their products don\u2019t meet basic standards.\nNeuberger also noted recent criminal ransomware attacks that have devastated health care systems, arguing those attacks spotlight the need for government and industry to take steps to tighten cyber security.\nA recent attack targeting Ardent Health Services prompted the health care chain that operates 30 hospitals in six states to divert patients from some of its emergency rooms to other hospitals while postponing certain elective procedures. Ardent said it was forced to take its network offline after the Nov. 23 cyberattack.\nA recent global study by the cybersecurity firm Sophos found nearly two-thirds of health care organizations were hit by ransomware attacks in the year ending in March, double the rate from two years earlier but dipping slightly from 2022.\n\u201cThe president\u2019s made it a priority. We\u2019re pushing out actionable information. We\u2019re pushing out advice,\u201d Neuberger said. \u201cAnd we really need the partnership of state and local governments and of companies who are operating critical services to take and implement that advice quickly.\u201d\n\u2014\nAssociated Press writers Frank Bajak in Boston and Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pa., contributed reporting.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Top White House cyber aide says recent Iran hack on water system is call to tighten cybersecurity", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/ap-iran-joe-biden-washington-white-house-b2461169.html"}
