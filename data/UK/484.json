Other aspects to be considered include whether troops currently on the front line would be rotated or allowed home leave after almost 22 months of full-scale war.\nUkrainian Ministry of Defense statistics say the Ukrainian army had nearly 800,000 troops in October. That doesn't include National Guard or other units. In total, 1 million Ukrainians are in uniform.\nEarlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the country\u2019s military to increase the number of troops by nearly 170,000 to a total of 1.32 million.\nRussia, Ukraine\u2019s far bigger neighbor, outguns and outnumbers Kyiv\u2019s forces.\nThe around 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line has barely budged this year as a Ukrainian counteroffensive ran up against sturdy Russian defenses. Now, with winter setting in, troop movements are being slowed by bad weather, placing grater emphasis on the use of artillery, missiles and drones.\nPutin said earlier Tuesday that the Kremlin\u2019s forces have taken the initiative in Ukraine and is well positioned for the coming year.\nZelenskyy, speaking at a year-end news conference, insisted that the Kremlin's forces had failed in their efforts to occupy more of Ukraine since their full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\nIt wasn't possible to independently verify battlefield claims by either side.\nZelenskyy said that Ukraine has received additional Patriot surface-to-air systems and advanced NASAMS anti-aircraft systems, providing medium- to long-range defense against Russian missile attacks, but declined to provide more details.\nThey will help fend off expected Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid over the winter.\nAmid signs of war fatigue among Ukraine\u2019s Western allies, Zelenskyy said that he was confident that the United States and European Union would make good on their promises of providing Ukraine with more military and financial support next year \u2014 a crucial issue for Kyiv as it fights its larger foe.\nIn other developments:\n\u2014 The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, said Tuesday that his agency has confirmed more than 10,000 civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion started. The number includes more than 560 children, he said.\n\u201cThe true toll is probably substantially higher,\u201d he said.\nAlso, T\u00fcrk said that his office is investigating six new reported cases of Russian soldiers allegedly killing civilians in Ukraine.\nSince the start of all-out war in Ukraine, the Russian military has repeatedly used missiles to blast civilian targets across the country, with devastating consequences.\n\u2014 The toll the war is taking on the Ukrainian economy was clear in figures published Tuesday that showed the volume of Ukraine\u2019s goods exports through November was 19.3% lower than in the same period last year.\nThe drop was due largely to Russia\u2019s \u201cblockade of seaports and Russian attacks on our export transport logistics,\u201d Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko tweeted.\nHowever, a recent uptick in sea exports came after Ukraine created a temporary grain corridor in the Black Sea and introduced a ship insurance mechanism, she said, adding that the growth bodes well for next year.\n___\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Zelenskyy says he is weighing Ukrainian military's request for mobilization of up to 500,000 troops", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/russia-ap-kyiv-kremlin-vladimir-putin-b2466772.html"}
