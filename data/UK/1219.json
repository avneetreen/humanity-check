However, it was not immediately clear when the forces would be fully trained and funded to allow for deployment.\nMeanwhile, Haiti is reporting a fresh round of gang-related killings and kidnappings as it awaits help.\nOn Wednesday, Haiti\u2019s Superior Court of Auditors and Administrative Disputes said five of its employees were kidnapped in the capital, Port-au-Prince, forcing the agency to temporarily postpone all hearings.\n\u201cThe court hopes that the civil servants, who do not receive a salary that allows them to meet the financial demands of the kidnappers, will be quickly released,\u201d it said in a statement.\nAlso this week, the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration said that nearly 2,500 people in the coastal town of Mariani located west of the capital were displaced by violence as gangs inltrate previously peaceful communities.\nNearly 200,000 Haitians have now lost their homes to gangs who pillage neighborhoods operated by rivals in their quest to control more territory. Many of the displaced are now sleeping outside or in makeshift settlements that are crowded and extremely unsanitary.\n\u201cIn a country where security is not a priority for the government, each time you go out, you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be shot at,\u201d said Mario Volcy, a 40-year-old construction worker as he waited for a bus in Port-au-Prince. \u201cThese guys have machine guns in their hands. They could surprise you by doing something crazy and dumb.\u201d\nVolcy travels from his hometown of Les Cayes, west of Port-au-Prince, to the capital on public transportation amid fears that he could be killed or kidnapped. He said bus fares have spiked because drivers now must pay gangs a \u201ctoll\u201d for safe passage.\nMore than 1,230 killings and 701 kidnappings were reported across Haiti from July 1 to Sept. 30, more than double the figure reported during the same period last year, according to the U.N.\nGangs continue to overwhelm Haiti\u2019s National Police, which remains understaffed and underfunded despite the international community supplying training and resources. In late October, two more police officers were killed, according to a police union, with a total of 32 officers slain so far this year.\nHaitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry first requested the immediate deployment of foreign armed forces more than a year ago, but it wasn\u2019t until early October that the U.N. Security Council voted to send a non-U.N. multinational force to Haiti that would be funded by voluntary contributions.\nBut even if the Kenyan forces arrive, it won\u2019t change much, said Pierre Esp\u00e9rance, executive director of the Haitian National Human Rights Defense Network.\n\u201cThe biggest problem right now in Haiti is the absence of the government and rule of law, and also all key state institutions have collapsed, even the police,\u201d he said. \u201cHow will the force be able to operate in Haiti if we don\u2019t have a functional government?\u201d\nEsp\u00e9rance also noted Haiti\u2019s government has long been linked to gangs, compounding the problem.\nA spokesperson for the prime minister\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIt\u2019s not clear when exactly Kenya\u2019s police would be deployed. In addition to waiting for training and funding, Kenya\u2019s government is awaiting resolution of a local court case blocking the deployment.\nA judge was expected to rule Thursday on a petition filed by former presidential candidate, Ekuru Aukot, who argued the deployment is unconstitutional. However, the case was pushed back for the second time in less than a month because the judge is attending a training.\nThe case is now scheduled to be heard on Nov. 16.\nKenya\u2019s Parliament also has to approve of the deployment.\nThe country\u2019s National Security Council petitioned Parliament on Oct. 25 to approve the deployment. The petition is currently with the Departmental Committee on Administration and Internal Security. It will be presented to the House later this month.\n___\nCoto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.
