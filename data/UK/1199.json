Israeli\u2019s former defence minister and current minister without portfolio Benny Gantz suggested that if journalists knew of the attack beforehand, they are \u201cno different than terrorists and should be treated as such.\u201d Danny Danon, former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, said \u201cwe will hunt them down together with the terrorists.\u201d\nThe accusations and threats lobbed at some of the world\u2019s biggest news organisations \u2013 including The New York Times, Associated Press, Reuters and CNN \u2013 were roundly condemned by press freedom groups and human rights watchdogs, as well as the outlets themselves, which have categorically denied the allegations.\n\u201cThe accusation that anyone at The New York Times had advance knowledge of the Hamas attacks or accompanied Hamas terrorists during the attacks is untrue and outrageous,\u201d according to a statement from the company. \u201cIt is reckless to make such allegations, putting our journalists on the ground in Israel and Gaza at risk.\u201d\nRelatives attend a funeral of Palestine TV journalist Mohamed Abu Hatab and several of his family members the day after they were killed in Gaza on 3 November. (AFP via Getty Images)\nRepublican US Senator Tom Cotton called on the US Department of Justice to investigate news outlets for \u201cfederal crimes by supporting Hamas terrorists.\u201d\nA letter from general counsel with The New York Times warned that his reliance on \u201cdisinformation\u201d and \u201cfalsehoods\u201d should \u201cnot be abused by a US senator to falsely accuse fellow Americans of crimes.\u201d\nHe has refused to retract his statements.\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely reckless for a group calling itself \u2018HonestReporting\u2019 to insinuate that photojournalists who take pictures of atrocities are complicit in them,\u201d Seth Stern, director of advocacy with the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told The Independent.\n\u201cDespite HonestReporting\u2019s recent backpedaling, it\u2019s a virtual certainty that their irresponsible speculation will be cited to justify past and future violence against the press. They\u2019ve put journalists\u2019 lives at risk,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s disgraceful for politicians \u2026 to cite the spurious report to call for violence against journalists and baseless investigations of news outlets.\u201d\nThe Independent has requested comment and clarification from HonestReporting.\nPalestinians rally in the West Bank city of Nablus on 6 November to support journalists in Gaza. (AFP via Getty Images)\nGaza\u2019s health ministry has reported more than 11,000 dead since Israel\u2019s siege began, including more than 4,500 children. The White House believes \u201cmany, many thousands of Palestinians\u201d have been killed. The US State Department says the death toll could be \u201ceven higher\u201d.\nAmong the dead are at least 39 media workers, including 35 Palestinians, four Israelis and one Lebanese journalist, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\nThe organisation also has reported at least three missing journalists and 13 journalists who have been arrested.\nThere have also been multiple \u201cassaults, threats, cyberattacks, censorship, and killings of family members\u201d within the last month, according to the group\u2019s research.\n\u201cNowhere is safe for journalists in the Gaza Strip,\u201d according to Reporters Without Borders. \u201cWhether they are out in the open, operating in press tents set up near hospitals, or in their homes or makeshift shelters with their family members, reporters in the Gaza Strip covering one of this century\u2019s deadliest wars are in constant danger of death.\u201d\nIn the immediate aftermath of Hamas attacks that killed hundreds in Israel on 7 October, at least three photojournalists were killed as they covered Israel\u2019s response. At least other reporters were killed during an Israeli strike three days later. That night, another four journalists, including members of their families, were killed in their homes, according to Reporters Without Borders.\nThis month, Mohammad Abu Hassir with Palestinian National Authority\u2019s Wafa press agency was reportedly killed in his home with several of his family members.\nPalestinian journalist shows reality of searching for water in Gaza\nPalestine TV correspondent Salman Bashir was on air earlier this month when he learned that a colleague, Mohammed Abu Hatab, was killed in a strike that reportedly destroyed his home. While reporting outside the hospital where his colleague and his family were pronounced dead, he ripped off his blue \u201cpress\u201d vest and cried.\n\u201cWe are dying one after the other, and no one looks at us anymore,\u201d he said into the camera. \u201cWe do not benefit from any protection, from any international protection. \u2026 These shields don\u2019t protect us. They are merely slogans.\u201d\nAbu Hatab\u2019s wife, two of his sons and four of his daughters were killed in the strike, according to Mr Bashir.\nAt least 10 journalists killed in Gaza were killed while clearly covering the news, Reporters Without Borders found. More than 50 media premises have also been destroyed under Israeli strikes, the organisation reported.\nPress freedom advocates and human rights organisations have feared Israel is intentionally targeting journalists in its strikes, which Israel\u2019s Defense Forces have denied.\n\u201cThe IDF does not purposefully target journalists, and takes measures to mitigate unintended harm to journalists and all civilians,\u201d according to a statement. IDF concedes that \u201chigh intensity strikes\u201d may \u201ccause damage to surrounding buildings and areas.\u201d\nLast month, Reuters videojournalist Issam Abdallah was killed in southern Lebanon during rocket strikes that injured six other journalists working for several agencies, including Agence France-Presse, Reuters and Al Jazeera.\nAccording to an investigation from Reporters Without Borders, the location was targeted by two strikes from the direction of Israel\u2019s border.\n\u201cOne of their vehicles, marked \u2018press,\u2019 was targeted, and it was also clear that the group stationed next to it was journalists,\u201d according to the report.\nCoverage in The Jerusalem Post, meanwhile, has accused Gaza journalists and \u201cinfluencers\u201d posting on social media of being \u201cHamas\u2019s propaganda team\u201d, coverage that has been widely condemned as inviting threats against them.\nHundreds of journalists have joined several international press associations to demand \u201can explicit commitment from Israel to end the violence against journalists and other civilians.\u201d\nAn open letter from Columbia Journalism School has called on \u201cbelligerents in the war to take all responsible precautions to protect journalists and guarantee their freedom to report information without restriction or censorship.\u201d\n\u201cJournalists make up only a fraction of the total civilian casualties of this war but the number of journalists killed is shocking,\u201d Mr Stern with the Freedom of the Press Foundation told The Independent. \u201cThe US government needs to do everything in its power to pressure its ally to stop targeting journalists, with either irresponsible rhetoric or bombs, and to protect press freedom.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "The \u2018unprecedented\u2019 death toll among Gaza\u2019s journalists", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/gaza-journalists-death-toll-israel-b2445517.html"}
