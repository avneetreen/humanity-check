Negotiations between the Philippines and Japan are also underway for a reciprocal access agreement that would allow Japanese and Philippine troop deployments to one another for military exercises and other security activities.\nThe Philippine and French defense chiefs agreed to deepen defense cooperation, including by boosting intelligence and information exchanges to address security threats, Teodoro said.\nThey agreed to sustain Philippine and French ship visits and underscored the importance of upholding international law, including the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, he said.\nThat language has often been used by the U.S. and the Philippines, along with their allies, in their criticism of China for its increasingly aggressive actions in the disputed South China Sea.\nFrance has deployed its navy ships to the South China Sea to promote freedom of navigation and push back against Chinese expansionism. China claims virtually the entire waterway and has constructed island bases protected by a missile system in the past decade, alarming smaller claimant states, including the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia.\nWashington has repeatedly warned that it is obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under armed attack, including in the South China Sea.\nThe Philippines recently staged joint air and naval patrols separately with the U.S. and Australia in the South China Sea, provoking an angry reaction from China, which warned that the joint patrols should not harm its sovereignty and territorial interests.\nPhilippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano said Friday that the joint patrols with U.S. and Australia would continue and could be expanded to include other friendly nations like Japan.\nAno spoke to invited journalists on Thitu Island, a Philippine-occupied island in the South China Sea, where he led the inauguration of a new coast guard monitoring station that would be equipped with a radar, satellite communications, coastal cameras and ship-tracking equipment to help counter what he described as China's \u201cpure bullying.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "France and Philippines eye a security pact to allow joint military combat exercises", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/france-ap-united-states-manila-minister-b2457289.html"}
