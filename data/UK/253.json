The country has been beset with violence from gangs battling for control in spiralling turf wars that see gun massacres and beheadings. Ecuador is situated between world-leading cocaine producers Colombia and Peru and has become a centre for foreign and domestic drug cartels. Guayaquil, a coastal city that is Ecuador's largest, is considered the country's most dangerous, with its ports a hub for drug smuggling. Noboa took office in November touting his 'Phoenix Plan' for security, including a new intelligence unit, tactical weapons for security forces, new high-security prisons and reinforced security at ports and airports. Security in Ecuador has been worsening since the coronavirus pandemic, which also brutally battered the economy. Ecuador's prisons have become a hotbed of violence, with the cartels fighting for power inside the country's jails, from which they then exert vast influence. Fishermen have been massacred at ports, maimed bodies have been hanged from bridges and riots have left hundreds dead in prisons. Prisons have become a hotbed of violence, with the cartels fighting for power inside the country's jails, from which they then exert vast influence. Since 2018, the national murder rate has more than quadrupled, soaring from six to 26 per 100,000 inhabitants - a rate that places it in the worst 15 countries. The country's National Police tallied 3,568 violent deaths in the first six months of 2023, far more than the 2,042 reported during the same period in 2022. That year ended with 4,600 violent deaths, the country's highest in history and double the total in 2021. Violent deaths nationally rose to 8,008 in 2023, the government has said, nearly double the 2022 figure. Violence in Ecuador culminated in August with the assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio, plunging the country into chaos. A national emergency was declared in the wake of the assassination, while Ecuador's economic capital, Guayaquil, has seen multiple successive states of emergency imposed. In the north, the city of Esmeraldas is also frequently at the centre of turf wars, as cartels battle for control over the country's key drug supply routes. Behind the violence is what the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime describes as a global 'prolonged surge in both the supply of and demand for cocaine'. As the US market turns to other drugs such as fentanyl, the European market has bolstered demand for the powder, with gangs in the Balkans as well as Italy's feared 'Ndrangheta mafia understood to have expanded into Ecuador.
