US secretary of state Antony Blinken expressed hope for the deal, saying: \u201cVery important, productive work has been done. And there is some real hope going forward.\u201d\nA senior Hamas official, Taher al-Nunu, said it wanted a \u201ccomplete and comprehensive ceasefire, not a temporary truce\u201d, although it was not immediately clear whether Hamas officials had received the Qatari text.\nJohn Kirby, a spokesperson for the national security council at the White House, told CBS: \u201cWe are not interested in a broader conflict in the region, we\u2019re not looking for another war, but we absolutely will do what we have to do to protect ourselves.\u201d\nPresident Joe Biden now faces a balancing act, blaming Iran and looking to strike back in a forceful way without causing any further escalation of the Gaza conflict. The White House said on Monday the president was \u201cweighing his options\u201d for a \u201cvery consequential\u201d answer to the attack.\nUS Republicans have suggested they would use Iran as a test case of Biden\u2019s strength ahead of the US elections. \u201cThe entire world now watches for signs that the president is finally prepared to exercise American strength,\u201d Republican senate minority Leader Mitch McConnell said.\nLindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate judiciary committee and a leading hawk, urged Biden to \u201chit Iran now. Hit them hard.\u201d\nIn describing the drone attack two US officials who were not authorised to comment and insisted on anonymity, said preliminary accounts suggest the enemy drone that struck the installation known as Tower 22 may have been mistaken for an American drone that was in the air at the same time.\nThe officials said that as the enemy drone was flying in at a low altitude, a US drone was returning to the base. As a result, there was no effort to shoot down the enemy drone.\nView image in fullscreen Sgt William Jerome Rivers, Specialist Breonna Alexsondria Moffett and Specialist Kennedy Ladon Sanders, who were killed in Jordan. Photograph: Us Army/Reuters\nThe attack, which the Biden administration blames on Iranian-based proxies, adds another layer of complexity to an already tense Middle East situation as the Biden administration tries to keep the Israel-Hamas war from expanding into a broader regional conflict.\nThe targeted base, known as Tower 22, sits near the demilitarized zone on the border between Jordan and Syria along a sandy, bulldozed berm marking the DMZ\u2019s southern edge. The Iraqi border is only 10km (6 miles) away.\nThe area is known as Rukban, a vast arid region that once saw a refugee camp spring up on the Syrian side over the rise of the Islamic State group\u2019s so-called caliphate in 2014.\nThe base\u2019s location offers a site for US forces to infiltrate and quietly leave Syria.\nUS troops long have used Jordan, a kingdom bordering Iraq, Israel, the West Bank, Saudi Arabia and Syria, as a basing point. Some 3,000 American troops typically are stationed across Jordan.\nHowever, the US presence in Jordan risks angering a population that has already held mass demonstrations against Israel\u2019s war on Hamas in Gaza over civilian casualties in a conflict that has already killed over 26,000 Palestinians.\nReuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Pentagon mulls response to Jordan drone strike amid fears for Gaza ceasefire efforts", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/29/pentagon-lloyd-austin-jordan-troops-killed"}
