The Turkish strikes have killed dozens, damaged health facilities, schools and camps, and displaced more than 120,000 civilians, he said.\nU.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield accused \u201cterrorist groups,\u201d some backed by Syria and Iran, of threating to expand the Gaza conflict \u201cby using Syrian territory to plot and launch attacks against Israel.\u201d She also accused Syria of allowing Iran and terrorist groups to use its international airports for military purposes.\n\u201cWe call on the regime to curb the activities of Iran-backed militias in Syria, stop the flow of foreign arms and fighters through its territory, and cease escalatory actions in the Golan Heights,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe United States has warned all actors not to take advantage of the situation in Gaza to widen or deepen the conflict,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve made clear that we will respond to attacks on our own personnel and facilities in Syria or against U.S. interests, and where appropriate exercise our right to self-defense forcefully, proportionately and in a manner that minimizes civilian harm.\u201d\nAmbassador Vassily Nebenzia of Russia, Syria\u2019s closest ally, accused Israeli forces of striking sites in Syria, including civilian airports, and called U.S. attacks in the country \u201cillegitimate actions\u201d and \u201ca gross violation of Syria\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d He also claimed U.S. economic interests and involvement \u201cin contraband with Syrian grain and oil\u201d have prevailed over political interests.\nNebenzia said there is a sharp increase in tensions around the Israel-Hamas conflict and attacks like the ones by the U.S. might provoke spillover to the entire region. \u201cThis must not be deemed acceptable,\" he said.\nIran\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Amir Iravani refuted all U.S. claims, saying his country is in Syria at Damascus' request to fight terrorism. He accused Washington of attempting \u201cto shift the blame from the culprit to the victim.\u201d\nIravani told the council the United States\u2019 \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Israel \u201chas rendered it part of the problem.\u201d He said the U.S. and some Western countries were attempting to give Israel an unjust right to self-defense while ignoring the Palestinian people\u2019s right to self-determination, and equating the Palestinian resistance with terrorism.\n\u201cIran\u2019s primary objective is to avoid any escalation in the region,\u201d the ambassador stressed, which is why it has endorsed international calls for an immediate cease-fire and humanitarian aid for people in Gaza.\nHowever, Iravani said Iran will respond to any threat, attack or aggression endangering its security.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "A UN envoy says the Israel-Hamas war is spilling into Syria, adding to growing instability there", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/syria-ap-israel-hamas-iran-b2438825.html"}
