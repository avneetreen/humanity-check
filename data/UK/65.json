Aliens invade, everyone panics, the US saves the world.\nWell, you can forget Independence Day-style heroics \u2013 the US would not be able to defend itself (or anyone else) against aliens, according to a damning official government report.\nThe US Department of Defense (DoD) has released a statement regarding a previously classified report examining the effectiveness of the nation to respond to the threat of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), formerly UFOs.\nInterest in UAP is at an all-time high among the lawmakers, the media and the public following US whistleblower Charles Grusch\u2019s claims that the US has recovered both spacecraft and alien bodies.\nHis comments helped prompt an official congressional hearing into the issue, during which Mr Grusch and two other former military personnel shared their experiences of UAP.\nIn July 2022, the Pentagon also set up the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), to handle reports of UAP.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nHowever, the Office of Inspector General (OIG), has questioned the abilities of the nation to organise and defend itself in a summary of the classified report, \u2018Evaluation of the DoD\u2019s Actions Regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena\u2019, first issued in August.\nThe statement says the OIG \u2018found that the DoD\u2019s lack of a comprehensive, coordinated approach to address UAP may pose a threat to military forces and national security\u2019.\nIt added: \u2018The DoD OIG found that the DoD does not have a comprehensive, coordinated approach to address UAP.\nThe US has released a number of videos revealing UAP (Picture: AARO/SWNS)\n\u2018For instance, the DoD OIG determined that the DoD has no overarching UAP policy and, as a result, it lacks assurance that national security and flight safety threats to the United States from UAP have been identified and mitigated.\u2019\nInspector General Robert P Storch said: \u2018Given the significant public interest in how the DoD is addressing UAPs, we are releasing this unclassified summary to be as transparent as possible with the American people about our oversight work on this important issue.\u2019\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nTo address the issues identified in the report, the DoD OIG say they have made 11 recommendations to the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security, in coordination with the Director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nThey said: \u2018For example, the DoD OIG recommended that the DoD issue a policy to integrate roles, responsibilities, requirements, and coordination procedures regarding UAP into existing intelligence, counterintelligence, and force protection policies and procedures.\u2019\nThat sounds a lot more complicated, and frankly less comforting, than \u2018Don\u2019t worry, Will Smith is on the case\u2019.\nMORE : A Welsh mountain sparked one of the UK\u2019s wildest UFO conspiracies \u2013 but what really happened?\nMORE : MoD expert gives surprising verdict on \u2018Jellyfish UFO\u2019 hovering over Iraq\nMORE : Whistleblower says US is hiding UFO the \u2018size of a football field\u2019", "source_domain": "metro.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "The US is officially unable to defend itself against an alien invasion", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2024/01/26/us-officially-unable-defend-alien-invasion-20177819/"}
