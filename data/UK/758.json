It marked an escalation in a series of maritime attacks in the Mideast linked to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\u201cWe are in talks with other countries about a maritime task force of sorts involving the ships from partner nations alongside the United States in ensuring safe passage,\u201d Sullivan told reporters. He noted similar task forces are used to protect commercial shipping elsewhere, including off the coast of Somalia.\nThe Houthi attacks imperil traffic on one of the world\u2019s most vital shipping lanes and with it global trade overall. The U.S. Energy Information Administration says 8.8 million barrels of oil a day are shipped through the Red Sea and the narrow straits of the Bab al-Mandab within range of the Houthis, making it one of world trade\u2019s most crucial chokepoints. The ships carry oil and natural gas from the Gulf to Europe, the United States and China.\nThe Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab are also part of a vital route for commercial shipping overall, carrying millions of tons of agricultural products and other goods to markets yearly.\nSullivan said that while the Houthis had \u201ctheir finger on the trigger,\" the group's Iranian sponsors were ultimately responsible.\n\u201cThe weapons here are being supplied by Iran,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIran, we believe, is the ultimate party responsible for this.\u201d\nSullivan said the U.S. does not believe that all three of the ships struck by the Houthis had ties to Israel, saying, \u201cIt goes to show you the level of recklessness that the Houthis are operating.\u201d\n\u2014\nAP writers Jon Gambrell and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed reporting.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "US, allies in talks on naval task force to protect shipping in Red Sea after Houthi attacks", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-jake-sullivan-houthi-red-sea-white-house-b2458330.html"}
