In a report by Associated Press, the head of Ukraine\u2019s ground forces, said that Russian troops had begun a push to regain territory near Bakhmut. The eastern mining city was the site of the war\u2019s bloodiest battle before falling into Russian hands in May. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi wrote on Telegram on Sunday afternoon: \u201cToward Bakhmut, the Russians have become more active and are trying to recapture previously lost positions. ... Enemy attacks are being repelled.\u201d A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman said on Sunday that Russian forces over the previous day repelled five Ukrainian attacks near Klischiivka and Kurdyumivka, two small settlements lying south of Bakhmut.\n12 Nov 2023 18.54 CET Russia has accused Kyiv of attacks on border regions. On Sunday, Russia said there had been a series of attacks in the border regions of Bryansk and Belgorod, damaging five train carriages and causing one injury. According to a report by Agence France-Presse, Moscow said it would open an investigation into a Ukrainian strike which injured a civilian in a village on the Ukrainian border, without giving more specifics. The governor of Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said that drones and missiles had targeted several areas in the region on Saturday. He said that in most cases they had not caused damage, but three houses and \u201cfive railway carriages were damaged\u201d in the town of Valuyki some 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Gladkov also said that power lines were hit, temporarily cutting off electricity. Overnight, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said it had destroyed two Ukrainian drones in the region, preventing what it called attempts at a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d, said AFP. Kyiv also said that a strike by Moscow caused the death of a 64-year-old man in the southern region of Kherson, and injured his wife. Ukrainian officials hailed the anniversary of the recapture of Kherson city on Saturday, the regional capital liberated a year ago in the last major frontline shift but which remains a target of Russian shelling.\n12 Nov 2023 18.17 CET Ukrainian refugees returning from Israel, have spoken of their struggle, saying they had left \u201cone war for another\u201d. Agence France-Presse report: Tetiana Kocheva fled her home in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern city of Kharkiv after Russia invaded last year, taking refuge in Israel\u2019s coastal town of Ashkelon, near Gaza. Her husband had worked in Israel in the past, and she thought taking their three children there - away from Russian attacks - would guarantee living in peace. But then came 7 October, when Hamas attacked Israel, leading to a war that has since killed thousands. Like several thousand other Ukrainian refugees, Kocheva fled war for a second time. \u201cIf I am killed then at least it\u2019s on my native land,\u201d the 39-year-old said. In the capital Kyiv, Anna Lyashko and her eight-year-old daughter Diana were also back from Israel. They had fled to Israel in the first weeks of Russia\u2019s invasion in March last year. They had been living close to areas of the Kyiv region that fell to Russian forces early in their attack, living without \u201celectricity, water or communication\u201d, the 28-year-old mother said. \u201cMy daughter was very scared and I decided to leave,\u201d she said. Lyashko decided to take her daughter to Israel, where she had a relative. But when hostilities started in Israel last month, it brought her back to the day Russia invaded Ukraine. \u201cMy first feelings were the same as 24th of February (2022) in Ukraine,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone called me in the morning and said \u2018Anna, war has started\u2019, it was exactly the same feeling I had in Ukraine.\u201d She said her daughter had \u201cfear in her eyes\u201d and that she \u201cunderstood that I could not stay\u201d. They flew out of Tel Aviv a week later, with the help of the Ukrainian embassy.\n12 Nov 2023 17.00 CET Summary of the day so far Dmitry Medvedev, Russia\u2019s former leader, posted on Telegram today an apparent response to a proposal put forth by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, a former Nato secretary general, to have Ukraine join the alliance without its currently Russian-occupied territories.

Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chair of Russia\u2019s security council, purported that it was basically an acknowledgment then that Crimea and Donbas were no longer Ukraine. \u201cNot bad, but it\u2019s important to move on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must admit that Odessa, Nikolaev, Kyiv, and practically everything else is not Ukraine at all.\u201d He claimed that there were three more steps \u201cbefore admitting the obvious\u201d: that Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2013 \u201cwho does not go to the polls\u201d, Medvedev said \u2013 is not the president but a usurper, the Ukrainian language is not a language and Ukraine is not a country \u201cbut artificially collected territories\u201d. Therefore, Ukraine, even without the Russian-occupied territories, cannot be accepted into Nato as it is not a country, reasoned Medvedev. This inaccurate notion that Ukraine is not an independent country, but instead a historical part of Russia, has been repeated in the rhetoric of Russian leadership for some time now. Vladimir Putin said this at a Nato summit in 2008, and again in 2014 when justifying the illegal annexation of Crimea. \u201cIn general, like the Russian propagandists have duly noted recently, they have nothing to lose already so they can say whaterver they want,\u201d said Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to Ukraine\u2019s minister of internal affairs. Medvedev (whom Russian themselves call \"The Sarmat of thr Russian thought) has launched a new \"missile\" in his Telegram channel:\n\"We must admit that Odesa, Nikolaev, Kiev and practically everything else are not Ukraine at all.\nAfter that there are only three steps until the\u2026 https://t.co/VjLB36aBRJ \u2014 Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) November 12, 2023\nUpdated at 15.38 CET\n12 Nov 2023 13.30 CET Kremlin press secretary: 'It is impossible to defeat Russia' Dmitry Peskov, press secretary for Vladimir Putin, said in a television interview that Kyiv needs to \u201cunderstand that it is impossible to defeat Russia\u201d.
