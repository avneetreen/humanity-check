The rapporteur for human rights and the environment, David Boyd, said damaging Gaza\u2019s sole water supply would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the environment and human rights.\nMedia reports, photographs and satellite imagery suggest the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have set up pumps at al-Shati refugee camp on the eastern coastline of the Gaza strip, which they could use to pump millions of gallons of seawater into the tunnels used by the militant group.\nIsraeli soldiers reportedly began trialling pumping seawater into the subterranean network last week, in an effort to drive Hamas\u2019s militants above ground and deny them a significant strategic tool.\nThe environmental consequences could be far-reaching. According to a study from the US military academy West Point, there were 1,300 tunnels stretching over 310 miles (500km) in Gaza at the start of the war in October. It has been estimated it would take 1.5m cubic metres of water to completely fill them.\nMark Zeitoun, director of the Geneva Water Hub and professor at the Geneva Graduate Institute, said seawater pumped into the hundreds of kilometres of tunnels crisscrossing the porous, sandy soil of Gaza would inevitably seep into the aquifer that its 2.3 million residents rely on for about 85% of their water.\nZeitoun, who has worked as a water engineer for the UN in the occupied Palestinian territories, said the aquifer was already badly contaminated from wastewater and from seawater infiltration caused by years of overabstraction.\n\u201cIf you add more seawater directly, right on through the sand into the aquifer, it\u2019s not going to turn a top-quality resource into a vulnerable resource, it will turn a vulnerable resource into a catastrophic one,\u201d Zeitoun said.\nHe said the contamination would be such that current neighbourhood-level reverse osmosis desalination methods used by Palestinians in Gaza to treat their water would no longer be feasible.\n\u201cIt would ruin the conditions of life of everyone in Gaza,\u201d he said. \u201cI say the conditions of life because I think that\u2019s one of the elements of genocide within the UN convention, the partial or complete physical destruction of the conditions necessary for life of any people.\n\u201cFlooding the freshwater aquifer with seawater would go against every norm humanity has ever developed, including the environment aspects of international humanitarian law/rules of war and the recent principles on the protection of environment in relation to armed conflict and all the progress made towards criminalising harm to the natural environment: ecocide.\u201d\nWim Zwijnenburg, a researcher for the Dutch NGO Pax for Peace, who investigates the environmental impacts of war, warned of additional dangers. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s stored in the tunnels,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere are reports floating around, which are not verified, but quoted by some sources [that] around 20,000 gallons of fuel is stored in the tunnels. So you have all those kinds of hydrocarbons that can potentially also affect the soil and get into the aquifer and groundwater.\u201d\nFlooding the tunnels would also pose risks for the integrity of the ground on which the communities of Gaza, the world\u2019s most densely populated territory, are built, Zwijnenburg warned. If they were to collapse beneath built-up areas, that could bring whatever buildings remain above them down as well.\nIf implemented in full, the IDF\u2019s tunnel-flooding plan would be the latest move in a long history of Israel\u2019s targeting of Palestinian water supplies. Even before the damage to water infrastructure caused by the latest bombardment of Gaza, supplies were precarious for people in the territory and in the West Bank, said Hadeel Ikhmais, the head of the climate change office at the Palestinian Environmental Quality Authority.\nIn the West Bank, Palestinians have no access to surface water, and must buy water from the Israelis. Israeli settlers and soldiers attacked water supplies in the West Bank about three times a month between January 2022 and mid-2023.\nIn Gaza, the groundwater aquifer is not recharging sufficiently to cope with demand due to a rising population and climate impacts including drought and higher temperatures. In the latest war, desalination plants, water harvesting and water treatment infrastructure have been targeted, leading to waste being discharged into the sea.\n\u201cThe disposal of wastewater into the sea makes it much more challenging to desalinate. By targeting water supplies, Israel is trying to make Gaza unliveable for Palestinians,\u201d Ikhmais said.\nThe UN Environment Programme said it had seen reports of Israel beginning to pump water into Gaza\u2019s tunnels. Responding to the Guardian, a spokesperson gave a similar assessment of the potential effects.\n\u201cThe coastal aquifer, an underground natural reservoir which runs from the Carmel mountain range in the north to the Sinai peninsula in the south, and the already fragile ecosystem of Gaza must be protected, so there is no impact on agriculture, industry and the environment, and so that people can use the groundwater safely,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\u201cAny method used by the warring parties during the conflict must take all precautions not to harm civilians, including impacting access to water and food resources.\u201d\nThe Israeli government and IDF did not respond to requests for comment.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Flooding Hamas tunnels with seawater risks \u2018ruining basic life in Gaza\u2019, says expert", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/23/israel-flooding-hamas-tunnels-seawater-risks-ruining-basic-life-gaza-expert"}
