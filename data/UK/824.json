Hurndall said that Palestinians in Gaza do not have the resources to investigate the death of civilian relatives in the same way.\n\u201cOnly when confronted with irrefutable evidence, and subjected to the unrelenting pressure of the UK government and press, did [the Israeli military] concede and accept responsibility. Unfortunately, Palestinian civilians do not have the resources or support to protect themselves in this way,\u201d he wrote.\nHe called on both the UK government and opposition to interrogate Israeli claims about civilian deaths in Gaza more rigorously.\n\u201cWestern governments and media appear overly willing to accept Israeli accounts and narratives and repeat them,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn doing so they actively encourage the killing of women and children, and are, in my view, themselves complicit in, or at least condoning, the deliberate killing of civilians and war crimes.\n\u201cThe situation has deteriorated since the time we were involved, as Israeli policy becomes more extreme. I believe the government and opposition in this country should carefully consider their positions over present events and over the situation in Israel and the occupied territories.\u201d\nHe said he was \u201ca longstanding supporter of the state of Israel\u201d and was reluctant to speak out, and did so only because asked, and in the hope that it would contribute to understanding and resolution.\n\u201cI wish Israel a happy, secure and prosperous future, but it needs to abandon policies which destroy the very prospects of such a future,\u201d he added.\nThe IDF has been contacted for comment.", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "West \u2018encourages\u2019 killing of civilians in Gaza, says father of activist shot dead by IDF", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/30/west-encourages-killing-of-civilians-in-gaza-says-father-of-activist"}
