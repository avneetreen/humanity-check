Nadia Calvi\u00f1o keeps the economy portfolio, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares remains in charge of foreign affairs and Margarita Robles stays at defense.\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialist party will hold 17 ministries and its leftist Sumar (Joining Forces) coalition partner will have five portfolios.\nThe outgoing government's former far-left coalition partner, Unidas Podemos (Unite We Can), will have no ministries. The party's former star, Equality Minister Irene Montero, will be replaced by Ana Redondo of the Socialist party.\nS\u00e1nchez was reelected prime minister on Thursday with backing from 179 lawmakers in Spain's 350-seat parliament. His election was opposed by 171 deputies from the center-right Popular Party and the far-right Vox.\nHis new term has gotten off to a stormy start after he clinched the support in parliament of two Catalan separatist parties in exchange for a controversial amnesty proposal for hundreds of people in legal trouble over the Catalonia region\u2019s failed secession attempt in 2017.\nThe proposal has triggered massive protests called by the Popular Party and Vox. Several held by extreme right-wing groups close to the Socialist party's headquarters in Madrid ended in clashes with police.\nSpeaking Monday, S\u00e1nchez promised to \u201cprioritize dialogue and negotiation in a legislature that will be key for the social and territorial cohesion of Spain.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Women make up more than half of ministers in the new Cabinet of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pedro-sanchez-ap-cabinet-socialist-spanish-b2450430.html"}
