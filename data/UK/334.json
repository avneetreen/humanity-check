Operations generate some $1 billion a year for the impoverished country of nearly 800,000 people that saw its economy expand by nearly 60% in the first half of this year.\nVenezuela has long argued it was cheated out of the territory when Europeans and the U.S. set the border. Guayana, which has controlled the zone for decades, says the original agreement was legally binding and the dispute should be decided by the International Court of Justice in the Netherlands.\nThe century-old dispute was recently reignited with the discovery of oil in Guyana, and has escalated since Venezuela reported that its citizens voted in a Dec. 3 referendum to claim Essequibo, which makes up two-thirds of its smaller neighbor.\nCritics of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro say the socialist leader is using the tensions to distract from internal turmoil and stoke nationalism in the lead up to presidential elections next year.\nIn recent weeks, the leaders of Guyana and Venezuela promised in a tense meeting that neither side would use threats or force against the other, but failed to reach agreement on how to address the bitter dispute.\nTensions came to another head with Friday's arrival in Guyana of the Royal Navy patrol ship HMS Trent, most recently used to intercept pirates and drug smugglers off Africa. It is equipped with cannons and a landing pad for helicopters and drones and can carry around 50 marines.\nMaduro said the ship's deployment violates the shaky agreement between Venezuela and Guyana, calling its presence a threat to his country. In response, Maduro ordered Venezuela's military \u2014 including air and naval forces \u2014 to conduct exercises near the disputed area.\n\u201cWe believe in diplomacy, in dialogue and in peace, but no one is going to threaten Venezuela,\u201d Maduro said. \u201cThis is an unacceptable threat to any sovereign country in Latin America.\u201d\nGuyana's government rejected Maduro's claims, with officials saying that the visit was a planned activity aimed at improving the nation\u2019s defense capabilities and that the ship\u2019s visit would continue as scheduled.\nDuring talks earlier in December, Guyanese President Irfaan Ali said his nation reserved its right to work with partners to ensure the defense of his country. Guyana has a military of only 3,000 soldiers, 200 sailors and four small patrol boats known as Barracudas, while Venezuela has about 235,000 active military personnel in its army, air force, navy and national guard.\n\u201cNothing that we do or have done is threatening Venezuela,\u201d Guyana\u2019s vice president, Bharrat Jagdeo, told reporters in Georgetown, the nation\u2019s capital.", "source_domain": "www.independent.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Venezuela says troops will stay deployed until British military vessel leaves waters off Guyana", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/venezuela-ap-guyana-british-nicolas-maduro-b2471386.html"}
