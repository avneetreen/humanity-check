Palestinian children crying out for lost parents and parents reasoning and writing their children's names on their hands and legs to be identified.\u2019\nThen, a child in the crowd inside a barn at the Dutch Creek Farms in Northfield, Minnesota let out cry of her own.\n\u2018It\u2019s okay. Kids are allowed to do that. Don't worry about it,\u2019 Biden joked.\nHe then asked if it was a boy or a girl who issued the cry. \u2018I don't blame her,\u2019 he quipped, getting a laugh even amid the dark news.\nBiden also spoke about the breakthrough in negotiations to finally get some dual citizens out of Gaza, after the White House said a 'handful' of Americans were among those who got out Wednesday as part of a broader deal.\n'This is a result of intense and urgent American diplomacy with our partners in the region,' Biden said. 'I personally spent a lot of time speaking with the Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and President Sisi of Egypt and others to make sure that we could open this access for people to get out,' he said.\nHe made the comment after the Israel Defense Forces struck a refugee camp for the second day in a row, in a bombing the government said took out a leading Hamas terror target\nHe thanked partners in the region and singled out Qatar for working 'closely with us' in the talks. Qatar has provided financial support to Hamas and hosts former Hamas leaders.\n'At the same time, we're continuing to work to significantly step up the flow of critical humanitarian assistance in Gaza,' Biden said, referencing an earlier breakthrough to get busloads of humanitarian aid into Gaza.\nThat comes after Israel has cut water and energy amid the start of its incursions into the territory, where Israeli troops are vulnerable to Hamas fighters and a network of miles of underground tunnels.\nEn route to Minnesota, national security spokesman John Kirby called the deal an 'important first step' and a 'significant breakthrough' to start getting the estimated 1,000 U.S. citizens who remain in Gaza out amid the fighting.\nBiden had a mostly uneventful flight to Minnesota, although the same can't be said of the reporters who followed him there.\nA Nighthawk helicopter ferrying reporters to the farm experienced four loud pops while taking off, and had to make an unscheduled landing at a public airport after smoke filled the cabin.\nThe reporters and photographers, including DailyMail.com, who follow Biden switched to a separate Osprey helicopter and quickly caught up with the president.\nThe White House said an 'electrical issue' had triggered some preventative alarms, including an automatic fire suppressant.\nBiden flew by helicopter to a Minnesota farm, where he spoke about his rural agenda and the situation in Gazas\nThe remarks came on a trip where Biden touted rural investments at an event that his White House team insists has nothing to do with his new primary challenger who just happens to hail from the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\nBiden's visit puts him back on the road amid a brewing international crisis overseas and an unexpected bump in his road to the Democratic presidential nomination. Last week, Rep. Dean Phillips, who represents the state's third congressional district, filed to run against Biden in the New Hampshire primary.\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Emilie Simons told reporters on 'Air Force One' the event had been planned months in advance, after she was asked about a statement by Phillips welcoming Biden to the state for what Phillips called a 'last-minute trip.'\nBiden, with more than $71 million in his campaign war-chest, ordinarily might not have to sweat a challenge from a third-term Democrat who has backed much of his policy agenda.\nBut Biden helped rearrange the Democratic primary schedule this year, and as a consequence of New Hampshire jumping the gun on Democratic Party calendar rules, his name won't appear on the ballot. That forces his party to organize a write-in campaign to avoid the potential humiliation of a loss to Phillips. The state's primary is expected to buck a party-sanctioned calendar that lets South Carolina break tradition and go first.\nU.S. President Joe Biden is welcomed by Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Gwen Walz, first lady of Minnesota, as he arrives in Northfield, Minnesota, U.S., November 1, 2023\nDown on the farm: President Biden heads to rural Minnesota Wednesday. His trip comes after Minnesota Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips announced he is running against Biden in New Hampshire\nAsked Tuesday if the visit had anything to do with Phillips, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre once again invoked the Hatch Act as a shield.\n'I said this last week, and I'll say this again: We are very proud of \u2013 or very thrilled and thankful to \u2013 to the Congressman for voting with the President almost 100 percent of the time in the last two years, and I'll leave it there,' she said.\nThe Hatch Act limits politicking on government property or on government time.\nInstead, Jean-Pierre said the trip was about pushing Biden's rural agenda \u2013 while failing to mention Biden also has a fundraiser scheduled with a Democratic hedge funder set for Minneapolis before his return trip.\n'The President says this all the time. He's the president for everyone. Again, I just said this at the top earlier when I was answering this question to one of your colleagues. It doesn't matter if it's a red state, blue state -- it doesn't matter. He is a president for everyone,' she said.\nThe trip comes days after Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN) announced he was challenging Biden in New Hampshire\nU.S. President Joe Biden visits a family farm in Kankakee, Illinois, U.S., May 11, 2022. He is set to be back on the farm in Minnesota Wednesday\n'So, it is important. It\u2019s not the first time he's going to a rural area to talk to Americans there. And so, he's going to do that tomorrow and talk about what he's done on behalf of this community, but on behalf of Americans across the country,' said Jean-Pierre.\nShe called Biden a 'president for everyone.'\n'You know, just as he goes to urban parts of the country, suburban parts of the country, to also visit rural areas of the country too,' she said.\nPhillips is experiencing his own problems. Democrats from his state have been lining up behind Biden. And Rep. James C. Clyburn (D-South Carolina) accused him of not 'respecting' the head of the party by going against the new calendar.\nBiden allies aren't waiting to pile on Phillips. Former Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) told Politico: 'The reality is [Phillips\u2019] bizarre effort running for president in the only state without delegates and with virtually zero support appears to be floundering less than a week after its launch \u2014 and throwing insults at one of the most revered and accomplished members of our party certainly isn\u2019t going to revive it.'\nBiden is expected to announce $5 billion in funds to help rural areas combat climate change.\nHe is expected to speak at Dutch Creek Farms in the town of Northfield. Its operators grow corn and soybeans, while raising hogs, one of many livestock animals known to contribute to methane emissions. The farm operators also take efforts to sequester carbon, the kind of environmental initiative the administration is promoting through billions in Inflation Reduction Act legislation.", "source_domain": "www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": null, "title": "Biden says Palestinian children are 'crying out for their parents', vows to get all Americans out of Gaza and urges Israel to protect citizens after refugee camp was bombed for the second day in a row", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12699391/Biden-cautions-Israel-speaks-devastating-images-Gaza-touts-deal-Americans-visit-Minnesota-farm.html?ns_mchannel=rssns_campaign=1490ito=1490"}
