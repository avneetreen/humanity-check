Met resources will be heavily deployed in areas with large Jewish and Muslim communities.\nCommander Findlay added: 'Regrettably, while the majority of protesters coming out in recent weeks have been peaceful, we have continued to see people taking part in offensive chanting or intentionally carrying placards that cross the line from political statements into racially or religiously aggravated offences.\n'By all means come out and protest to make your voice heard as is your right, but if your aim is to offend, to incite hatred, or to cause fear and intimidation then you should stay away.'\nRather than a huge march in London , as has been seen in recent weeks, dozens of events are due to take place in different parts of the UK today (picture of a protest on Wednesday)\nBritish

action which will involve trade unionists.\nLabour was left in chaos this week as MPs faced pressure from members and pro-Palestinian activists to back a vote for a ceasefire in Gaza, especially after 19 shadow ministers defied the leadership to speak in favour of a ceasefire.\nIn the end, ten frontbenchers and 46 other Labour MPs sided with the SNP amendment to the King's Speech which demanded an

antisemitic slogans and sickening support for Hamas.\nMeanwhile, the CAA filmed several protesters comparing Israel to Nazi Germany, with one branding Benjamin Netanyahu 'worse than Hitler'.\nThe Metropolitan Police said that a 'significant' policing operation is planned for the capital this weekend as it plans to crackdown on any hateful behaviour.\nCommander Karen Findlay, who is leading the Met's operation in London, said: 'Whilst there is no single large central protest event on Saturday, our policing priorities remain the same across the local events that are due to take place.\n'We are here to ensure that people can exercise their right to protest but to make sure that is done lawfully, and that unreasonable disruption to the lives of other Londoners is kept to a minimum.\n'Our officers will intervene swiftly where they see offences taking place. In particular, I want to reiterate that there is no place for hate in London.
