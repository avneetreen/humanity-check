Responses from the colleges tended to come through by email, usually between midnight and 2am Palestinian time.\nThe 18-year-old Palestinians, who had been friends since they were small children, spent that period video-chatting. As each one opened his email \u2013 \u201cyes, you have been accepted\u201d; \u201csorry, your application has been denied\u201d \u2013 he had two friends there for support.\nEventually, they were able to celebrate: all three earned places at universities, in Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Rhode Island. After a horrific shooting over the weekend, Awartani, Abdalhamid and Ali Ahmad have had to offer each other a different kind of support.\nThe three friends, all now 20 years old, were on their way to Thanksgiving dinner at Awartani\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house in Burlington, Vermont, when a white man fired at them with a handgun. One of the bullets struck Awartani\u2019s spine, and he may not walk again.\nJason J Eaton, 48, was arrested on Sunday afternoon and charged with attempted murder. He has pleaded not guilty.\nPolice are investigating whether to charge Eaton with a hate crime; Burlington police say the three men had been speaking Arabic, and two had been wearing keffiyehs. The shooting has fuelled anxiety about the rise in violence against Muslim and Arab people in the US, which has also seen an increase in antisemitic incidents.\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, as the three were treated in hospital, there was some comfort in having each other there.\nAwartani (center) and Abdalhamid (right) with another childhood friend. Photograph: Courtesy Elizabeth Price\nAwartani and Abdalhamid have been friends since they were babies. \u201cThey were forced to be friends,\u201d Awartani\u2019s mother, Elizabeth Price, said, noting that their parents had been close. Ali Ahmad, who is keeping a low profile in the media as he recovers, has been part of the trio for almost as long, since joining the two at the Ramallah Friends School, where all three excelled.\n\u201cThey\u2019re incredibly tight,\u201d Price said.\n\u201cI would say that they are brothers. And when they got shot, the hospital very kindly put all of them in one ICU room, and I think that was very instrumental in helping them to deal with the trauma of the experience.\n\u201cThey were teasing each other, and talking to each other. My mother slept there that first night and she said it was like a sleepover.\u201d\nPrice, a US citizen who has lived in the West Bank for 25 years, arrived in Burlington on Wednesday, having traveled from Ramallah to Jordan before flying to the US.\nAwartani and Abdalhamid, who suffered the worst injuries, are in a lot of pain, Price said. Awartani has been left \u201cpotentially paralysed\u201d by the shooting; he has feeling in his legs \u2013 a good sign, Price said \u2013 but cannot move them.\nStill, the 20-year-old has \u201cbeen joking around\u201d in recent days. His grandmother had recently bought him a Cardiff rugby shirt \u2013 Price\u2019s family has links to Wales \u2013 and Awartani was quick to tell her that at least he hadn\u2019t been wearing the shirt when he was shot.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a wicked sense of humor, which will stand him in good stead,\u201d Price said.\n\u201cPalestinians have had to struggle for 75 years in very difficult circumstances, and resilience is bred into these boys.\u201d\nAwartani had been shot before: when he was a teenager in Palestine, the Israeli military shot him with a rubber bullet during a protest against Israel\u2019s occupation. He has been studying at Brown University, a prestigious Ivy League college set on a leafy campus in Providence, for the past two years. He is working toward two degrees, in pure mathematics and archaeology, his mother said, and prior to Saturday, was planning work on an archaeological dig in Italy.\nIf all had gone to plan, Awartani would have seen his 13-year-old brother and 17-year-old sister later this month. He had been aiming to return to Ramallah for Christmas, although his father had concerns.\nView image in fullscreen Awartani with his mother, Elizabeth Price. Photograph: Courtesy Elizabeth Price\n\u201c\u200b\u200bMy husband really didn\u2019t want Hisham to come back,\u201d Price said.\n\u201cTraveling on West Bank roads is very dangerous, so my husband did not want to expose Hisham to being hurt on the way back to Ramallah.\u201d\nWhile Ramallah has been relatively safe since the Israel-Hamas war broke out in November, that\u2019s not so for other parts of the West Bank. On Wednesday two boys, Adam Samer al-Ghoul, eight, and Basil Suleiman Abu al-Wafa, 15, were killed by Israeli Defense Forces in the city of Jenin. About 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since Hamas\u2019s rampage in southern Israel on 7 October, which killed about 1,200 people. The IDF\u2019s retaliatory attacks on Gaza to the south have so far killed almost 15,000 people, including more than 6,000 children.\n\u201cNow he\u2019s not coming back,\u201d Price said. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming back for a while.\u201d\nAwartani faces months of recovery. A written statement he provided after the shooting contained signs of his sense of humor.\n\u201cWho knew that all I had to do to become famous was to get shot?\u201d Awartani said in the statement, which was read out loud at a vigil at Brown by Beshara Doumani, a professor of Palestinian studies at the school.\nIn the statement, Awartani urged students to view what happened to him as part of a much broader context.\n\u201cI am but one casualty in this much wider conflict. Had I been shot in the West Bank where I grew up, the medical services which saved my life here would likely have been withheld by the Israeli army. The soldier who would have shot me would go home and never be convicted,\u201d Awartani said.\nView image in fullscreen People gather in Pliny Park in Brattleboro, Vermont, for a vigil on 27 November for Ali Ahmad, Abdalhamid and Awartani.

Both ended up at Brown.\nAshhab would call Awartani \u201cWikipedia\u201d for the depth of his general knowledge. (\u201cHe\u2019s like a kid in a candy store at Brown,\u201d Price said of Awartani. \u201cHe\u2019s studied Aramaic, he\u2019s done Persian, he\u2019s doing Italian, he was learning Spanish for a while, as well as doing graduate-level math courses, topology and algebra. \u200b\u200bI think for him going to college is just exhilarating.\u201d)\nBut Awartani and Ashhab don\u2019t spend all their time studying. Awartani is a keen follower of Brighton and Hove Albion FC, the English football team, and is a \u201cbit of a chef\u201d, Ashhab said. Earlier this year he invited an intimidatingly large number of people over to their shared apartment for a mid-Ramadan feast.\n\u201cWe spent hours cooking,\u201d Ashhab said. \u201cWe made so much. Hisham cooks a lot of Arab and Palestinian food. He also makes his own kefir yoghurt, we made baba ganoush \u2026 \u201d\nAshhab and Awartani both protested against Israeli strikes on Gaza in 2021, which is when Awartani was shot by a rubber bullet, Ashhab said, in a grim echo of what would happen in Vermont two years later.\nView image in fullscreen Awartani (right) with his friend Aboud Ashhab. Photograph: Courtesy Elizabeth Price\nBoth are also active in campus politics. They are members of the Brown Students for Justice in Palestine, and have spoken up against Brown University\u2019s response to Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. In October, Ashhab, Awartani and several other students attended a meeting with university administrators to demand better protection for Arab students, and to ask the school to denounce Israel\u2019s bombing campaign in Gaza.\nThe university\u2019s response remains a source of frustration.\n\u201cIt took a Palestinian being shot to actually have some acknowledgement of what we\u2019re going through from the university administration,\u201d said Sherena Razek, a Palestinian-Canadian and a PhD candidate at Brown, who was part of the meeting with Brown higher-ups.\nRazek first met Awartani when he spoke at a vigil at Brown, held for lives lost in Gaza.\n\u201cHe was a profound speaker, his words really resonated with me. He shared a personal story. It\u2019s also very upsetting to have heard Hisham share a personal story about having been targeted and shot by the Israeli military during a protest with a rubber bullet in his leg, and to see that these bullets followed him here to America,\u201d Razek said.\n\u201cBut he just framed the Palestinian condition so beautifully. He has very young bright energy.\u201d\nSince 7 October, when Hamas attacked Israel, and Israel responded with an unprecedented bombardment that has killed thousands and forced 1.8 million people to flee their homes, hate crimes against Muslim, Arab and Jewish communities have spiked, according to the FBI.\nThe charged climate in the US, and the government\u2019s vocal support of Israel\u2019s military campaign, have led many to fear for their safety, including Inteemum Ahsan, a friend of Abdalhamid at Haverford College.\nView image in fullscreen Classmates from Ramallah Friends School, including Tahseen Ali Ahmad (second from left), Kinnan Abdalhamid (center) and Hisham Awartani (far right). Photograph: Courtesy Elizabeth Price\n\u201cAs a brown Muslim student from Bangladesh, I am terrified,\u201d Ahsan said.\n\u201cBeing reminded of the threat of violence and hate by the attack on Kinnan this weekend is horrifying and heartbreaking.\u201d\nAhsan, 21, has been friends with Abdalhamid since the latter arrived at Haverford, about 10 miles north-west of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a warm, energetic person. He is a caring friend, and an impactful community member,\u201d Ahsan said.\nAbdalhamid, who holds US citizenship, was released from hospital on Thursday. A pre-med student at Haverford, he\u2019s described as \u201csomething of a science genius\u201d by Micah, a close friend who asked that his real name not be used, adding: \u201cWe love to jump around singing our favorite hip-hop lyrics completely carefree.\u201d\nIn addition to listening to music, Micah and Abdalhamid lift weights together, Micah said, where they \u201care constantly competing\u201d. (Micah did not say who could lift more.) Abdalhamid, a talented runner, is a member of the men\u2019s track and field team.\nThe shooting has left friends and family of the three men confused, angry and sometimes scared.\n\u201cI felt so sad, angry and shocked,\u201d Micah said. \u201cI also felt a sense of guilt. Kinnan, a US citizen, came to America seeking an education, and this is how we treat him? I also began to think about how desensitized even I am, a Black American man, to hateful violence.\u201d\n\u201cFor the past two months, I have been reading in the news every day about Israel\u2019s bombing and killing of Palestinians in Gaza ... it\u2019s easy to forget that each one of them is loved and supported by a big network of friends and family, just like Kinnan is.\u201d", "source_domain": "www.theguardian.com", "text": null, "title": "Young, bright, Palestinian: the three friends shot in Vermont", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/02/vermont-palestinians-students-three-friends-shot"}
