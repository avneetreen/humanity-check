(Source: Screenshot/Instagram/Modified by Logically Facts)\nFact-Check The Verdict False Speech made by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Victory Day Parade in 2021 has been wrongly linked to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Claim ID 2285c040\nWhat is the claim?\nA short clip of Vladimir Putin speaking from a podium has been shared with the claim that the Russian President announced support for Palestine. The video shows military personnel saying, \"Hurrah, hurrah!\" after Putin\\'s remarks. The text \"Putin Announced Russia Will Openly Help To Palestine (sic)\" has been overlaid on the video (archived here). Various users shared the video on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook (archived here and here) with the caption, \"Vladimir putin announced Russia will openly help to Palestine, No one can stop us (sic)…\"\nScreenshots of the viral posts on X and Facebook. (Source: Facebook/X/Modified by Logically Facts)\nWhat are the facts?\nWe found that Putin did not say anything signifying Russia\\'s support for Palestine in the short viral clip. Logically Facts translated Putin\\'s remarks made in the speech captured in the short clip. The Russian President had said, \"Glory to the victorious nation! Congratulations! Congratulations on the Great Victory Day!\" He made no reference to Palestine in the speech originally delivered in Russian.\nThrough reverse image search, we found that the clip is from the Victory Day Parade held on May 9, 2021, in Moscow. On its YouTube page, Komsomolskaya Pravda, a Russian newspaper, had posted a longer version of the viral video on May 9, 2021. According to the description, the video showed the celebration of the 76th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War, which traditionally takes place in the famous Red Square of Moscow every year to commemorate the occasion. The viral clip runs from the 37:05 mark to the 37:21 timestamp of the YouTube video.\nFurther, we found the transcript of Putin\\'s speech from the event published on the President of Russia\\'s website on May 9, 2021. On reading the transcript, it can be noted that Putin didn\\'t mention Palestine or anything about providing any support to its people. There is also no mention of any entities relating to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict.\nLogically Facts has previously debunked social media posts falsely claiming that Putin warned the U.S. against interfering in the Israel-Hamas conflict that started in early October.\nThe verdict\nAn old video of Putin has been shared with false context, claiming he announced Russia\\'s support for Palestine. Putin was speaking at a Victory Day Parade held in 2021. Therefore, we mark the claim false.",

    "maintext":"Visuals of baby killed in Gaza falsely shared as Palestinians faking infant\\'s death with a doll\nBy: Ishita Goel\nDecember 5 2023 Share Article:\nSocial media posts faslely claim that visuals of a doll are being peddled as a dead infant killed by Israeli forces. (Source: Facebook/X/Modified by Logically Facts)\nFact-Check The Verdict False According to several Palestinian journalists, the visuals show a 5-month-old baby killed in Gaza in an Israeli airstrike. Claim ID 1897d523\nWhat is the claim?\nThe official death toll in Gaza has crossed 15,000 since the Israel-Hamas conflict started in early October. Amid the conflict, several social media users, including influencers, have shared visuals to mock civilians in Gaza and claim that Palestinians are using \\'crisis actors\\' and are \\'faking\\' injuries and deaths to garner sympathy from the international community.\nAs part of this narrative, two visuals of an infant wrapped in a white sheet are going viral on social media with the claim that they do not show a real baby but a doll. One 24-second clip shows a woman holding the infant and weeping. The other clip, which is over 47 seconds long, shows an older man holding the baby and addressing some people around him as he shows them the infant in his arms.\nOne X user shared the two videos (archived here) with the caption, \"Palestinians\\' in Gaza display a baby doll, claiming it\\'s a real baby killed by the IDF.\" \"A Palestinian woman sheds tears over a baby doll that was \"killed\" by Israel\\'s bombardment,\" wrote some users (archived here and here.)\nScreenshots of the viral posts on X and Facebook. (Source: Facebook/X/Modified by Logically Facts)\nThe claim was amplified by the Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post, in a now-removed X post (archived here), shared on December 1, 2023. The post read, \"Al Jazeera posts blurred doll, claims it to be a dead Palestinian baby.\" The outlet said that the footage shared on Al Jazeera\\'s X account claimed that the doll was a \"month-and-a-half-old baby\" killed by an Israeli bomb and shared images of the baby being held by the man seen in the viral clip. The X post also carried a link to a report that is no longer available on The Jerusalem Post\\'s website. On December 2, the outlet posted a clarification on X, \"Over the weekend, we shared an article based on faulty sourcing. The article in question did not meet our editorial standards and was thus removed.\"\nContrary to claims made online, the viral visuals do show an infant killed in an Israeli airstrike.\nWhat are the facts?\nWe could see an overlaid text crediting the account \\'Omar_aldirawi\\' in a few of the visuals of the baby shared on social media. Taking a clue from that, we traced the visual to Aldirawi\\'s Instagram page.\nAccording to his Instagram bio, Aldirawi is a Palestinian photojournalist from Gaza. On December 1, he shared a video of the woman holding the baby with a caption in Arabic, that, in English, read, \"A mother bid farewell to her martyr child, who was no more than 5 months old and was one of the targets of the occupation. This morning, after it violated the truce.\" In the next post, he shared a video of the same older man from the viral clip holding the baby and wrote, \"One of the occupation targets bank is a child not older than 5 months old.\" In another post the same day, he shared clearer footage of the infant, captioned, \"Children of Gaza are under the sun, oh world.\"\nSimilarly, we found a post by another photojournalist, Ali Jadallah, shared on December 1. The post showed the face of the same baby from the two viral clips. The accompanying caption read: \"Dead body of a 5-month-old Palestinian baby named Muhammad Hani Al-Zahar, is brought to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital by his mother Asmahan Attia Al-Zahar and grandfather Attia Abu Amra after the Israeli airstrikes at the end of the humanitarian pause in Deir Al-Balah, Gaza on December 1, 2023. 32 Palestinians were killed within 3 hours of the end of the humanitarian pause in Gaza.\" Jadallah\\'s Instagram post showed that the photo had been taken for Anadolu Agency.\nGetty Images also published multiple images clearly showing the baby held by the woman and the older man, crediting Jadallah and Anadolu Agency for the photos. We matched faces in the visuals shared by Aldirawi, Jadallah and Getty Images to the viral clips. Getty Images also identified the woman as the baby\\'s mother and the older man as the grandfather.\nPhoto website Alamy also carried images of the dead child. The images were attributed to Omar Ashtawy, a photojournalist working for APA Images. These photos also identified the baby as a 5-month-old Palestinian baby named Muhammad Hani Al-Zahar.\nThis is not the first time that it has been claimed that Palestinians are \\'faking\\' death and using dolls. In October, Logically Facts debunked a similar claim where a man was actually carrying a child\\'s body wrapped in a shroud. More than 6,600 Palestinian children have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since October 7, while thousands more are buried under rubble, an Al Jazeera report dated December 4 quoted the Palestinian government\\'s media office as saying.\nClaims trying to downplay civilian harm in Gaza by alleging that Palestinians are \\'faking\\' injuries and deaths are part of the \\'Pallywood\\' narrative— a combination of the words Palestine and Hollywood—spread by pro-Israeli social media accounts. Logically Facts\\' breaks down this narrative here.\nThe verdict\nVisuals of a real baby who died during an Israeli airstrike are being shared with the claim that they show a doll and Palestinians \\'faked\\' an infant\\'s death. However, the videos show the mother and grandfather of the deceased child, who were mourning the latter\\'s death.",

It is a 2015 video showing an incident involving Israeli soldiers and Palestinian youth in the West Bank.\nOn Nov. 21, an FB user published the video now circulating on local social media with this headline:\n“Israel vs Palestine live war #war #worldwar #army #soldier #israel #palestine #gaza #bomb”\nThe four-minute video showed a military jeep, engulfed in flames, firing at a group of people before ramming into one of them. Military personnel are later seen pushing away people who approached the person who was run over.\nA reverse image search shows that this was published in 2015 by Middle Eastern news organization Roya News. The video shows an incident in Ramallah, Palestine that resulted in Israeli forces running over a Palestinian.\nLocal news reports there said Israeli soldiers on a jeep rammed a Palestinian youth and prevented medical personnel and journalists from approaching the victim by spraying pepper spray. However, Israel authorities said the person allegedly approached them while holding a petrol bomb.\nThis old video erroneously described as recent footage emerged after Israel and Hamas ended their week-long ceasefire, during which hostages and captives were exchanged. Fighting between the two groups has resumed.\nFB page Zahid Joy (created on Nov. 6) published the video, garnering over 3,500 reactions, 1,000 comments, 420 shares and 126,000 views.\nHave you seen any dubious claims, photos, memes, or online posts that you want us to verify?

Junto ao vídeo, há mensagens que apontam que isso teria ocorrido por conta da candidata que é uma mulher trans. Leia o texto que circula online e assista ao vídeo:\nA Miss Colômbia armou um escândalo e em lugar de pedir paz para o mundo desancou tudo e todos por causa da presença de “mulheres” com testículos e Maça de Adão no concurso de Miss Universo. Os eunucos que arranjem um concurso para eles… anormais e anti-natura e anti-Deus\nA Miss Colômbia armou um escândalo e em lugar de pedir paz para o mundo desancou tudo e todos por causa da presença de “mulheres” com testículos e Maça de Adão no concurso de Miss Universo. Os eunucos que arranjem um concurso para eles… anormais e anti-natura e anti-Deus😮 pic.twitter.com/YtEDYVJU0s — Os mamões de Nabarone (@afofigueiredo) November 28, 2023\nChecagem\nNa parte da verificação do conteúdo, vamos responder a algumas questões: 1) É verdade que a Miss Colômbia armou um escândalo por causa de uma mulher trans no Miss Universo? 2) Qual foi o motivo da indignação da Miss Colômbia? 3) Há algum motivo para indignação por uma mulher trans estar participando de um concurso como este?\nÉ verdade que a Miss Colômbia armou um escândalo por causa de uma mulher trans no Miss Universo?\nNão é verdade. O vídeo, de fato, é de uma candidata a um concurso de miss que representava a Colômbia. E, de fato, ela estava indignada. Porém, não se trata de uma mulher que criticava uma transexual. O Miss Universo de 2023 já ocorreu, teve a participação de duas candidatas trans (Marina Machete, de Portugal, ficou no top 20) e não teve a tal confusão. O vídeo é de outra situação.\nQual foi o motivo da indignação da Miss Colômbia?\nNa realidade, a confusão se deu durante o concurso Miss Global de 2020. Na ocasião, Jesenia Orozco acusou a organização do concurso (realizado no México) de ter fraudado a competição. De acordo com esta matéria da época, ela disse o seguinte (já traduzido):\n“Isso é uma falta de respeito, precisamos ser justos. É uma fraude, é uma fraude! Há uma corrupção imensa no México e não é justo, não é correto o que estão fazendo aqui. É uma falta de respeito para todas as mulheres que estão aqui. Eles precisam ser justos… é inaceitável a corrupção, é inaceitável a falta de respeito, a falta de dignidade, e eu não aceito. Vim ao México, primeira vez que estou aqui. Acho as pessoas adoráveis, uma gente linda, e estão nos fazendo parecer mal como latinos”.\nA indignação ocorreu por conta da organização (ou desorganização do concurso). Uma das “broncas” foi porque a vencedora, a Miss República Checa, já havia sido eliminada anteriormente. No final e após tantos erros, não houve anúncio oficial de vencedora.\nHá algum motivo para indignação por uma mulher trans estar participando de um concurso como este?\nUma disputa “roubada” por gerar indignação. Agora, o fato de uma mulher trans ter participado do concurso e avançado nas disputas não é motivo. Neste sentido, se a “representante da Colômbia” tivesse falado sobre “testículos” e “maçã de adão”, estaria mais para “miss baixaria”.\nConclusão\nFake news ❌\nÉ falso que o vídeo que está circulando na internet seja da candidata da Colômbia ao Miss Universo indignada com uma mulher trans. O vídeo foi gravado em outro contexto e nada tem a ver com transfobia.\nPs: Esse artigo é uma sugestão de leitores do Boatos.org.

    "maintext":"Waarschuwing: deze factcheck bevat verwijzingen en links naar schokkende beelden.\nDe oorlog tussen Israël en Hamas gaat gepaard met een golf van verontwaardigde berichten op sociale media, met daarbij ook heel wat foutieve informatie. Dat tonen het volgende artikel van Reuters Institute en dit overzicht van het persagentschap AP News met de meest recente desinformatie over het conflict aan.\nSinds begin oktober wordt online beweerd dat leden van Hamas bij de aanval op de Israëlische kibboets Kfar Aza veertig baby’s onthoofd zouden hebben. Verschillende media - zoals Knack en The Intercept - deden al onderzoek naar de bewering en concludeerden dat er geen bewijs voor is.\nNu duikt ook een afbeelding op die moet aantonen dat de bewering waar is. Op de afbeelding zouden de lichamen van veertig onthoofde baby’s te zien zijn. De foto gaat onder meer rond op Twitter en Instagram. Het toont een container met daarin – geblurde – verbrande lijken.\nAfbeelding van @jewishbreakingnews. Zwart vlak toegevoegd door factcheck.vlaanderen.\nVerhaal komt voort uit reportage van Israëlische nieuwszender\nDe bewering dat Hamas veertig baby’s onthoofd heeft, komt voort uit een reportage van Nicole Zedeck, een correspondente voor de Israëlische nieuwszender i24news. Deze journaliste bracht op 10 oktober verslag uit van de aanval van Hamas op Kfar Aza, een kibboets in het zuiden van Israël, nabij de Gazastrook. De reportage van i24news werd onder meer gepubliceerd op X en op YouTube (vanaf minuut 53:45).\nCombinatie van twee afzonderlijke uitspraken\nTijdens het live-verslag zegt Nicole Zedeck dat “een soldaat haar vertelde dat minstens veertig baby’s op brancards naar buiten werden gebracht.” In een ander interview dat Zedeck afnam, zei de Israëlische commandant David Ben Zion dan weer dat “Hamas de hoofden van vrouwen en kinderen heeft afgehakt.” In dat interview werd geen specifiek aantal meegegeven. Later verstuurde Nicole Zedeck zelf nog een tweet waarin ze schreef dat “er volgens soldaten veertig baby’s/kinderen vermoord werden.”\nDe bewering over de veertig onthoofde Israëlische baby’s lijkt dan ook een combinatie te zijn van twee afzonderlijke uitspraken die te horen waren in reportages op i24news. Dat was ook de conclusie van factcheck.org.\nIsraëlische en Amerikaanse functionarissen namen de bewering over\nVerschillende bekende Israëlische en Amerikaanse functionarissen namen de bewering over en zorgden er op die manier voor dat de claim aan belangstelling won. Onder meer de Amerikaanse president Joe Biden zette de bewering kracht bij door te zeggen dat “hij nooit had gedacht om bevestigde foto’s te zien van terroristen die kinderen onthoofden.” Dat zei hij op 11 oktober tijdens een vergadering in Het Witte Huis met Joodse leiders.\nOok Tal Heinrich, een woordvoerder van de Israëlische premier Benjamin Netanyahu, verklaarde op 11 oktober dat “er in Kfar Aza onthoofde baby’s en kinderen gevonden werden.” Dat vertelde ze aan CNN.\nTijdens het bezoek van Joe Biden en Antony Blinken (de Amerikaanse minister van Buitenlandse Zaken) aan Israël zei premier Netanyahu dan weer dat Hamas wel degelijk mensen had onthoofd, maar hij sprak niet specifiek over baby’s of kinderen.\nFunctionarissen kwamen terug op hun uitspraken\nEnkele dagen na zijn uitspraak over de onthoofde kinderen kwam Joe Biden terug op wat hij gezegd had. De Biden-administratie verduidelijkte op 12 oktober dat de president verwees naar onbevestigde uitspraken van journalisten en Israëlische autoriteiten.\nOok het statement van Tal Heinrich aan CNN werd een dag nadien ingetrokken. De Israëlische regering liet weten dat ze de bewering, dat leden van Hamas de hoofden van baby’s hebben afgesneden, niet kon bevestigen. Dat is te lezen in een artikel van CNN.\nOok geen officiële bevestiging van het Israëlisch defensieleger\nThe Intercept, een Amerikaanse nieuwssite voor onderzoeksjournalistiek, nam rechtstreeks contact op met het Israëlisch defensieleger (IDF) en vroeg om meer uitleg. Een woordvoerster van het IDF antwoordde dat “vrouwen, kinderen, peuters en ouderen op een brutale manier afgeslacht werden en dat ze zich bewust zijn van de gruwelijke daden waartoe Hamas in staat is.” In een telefoongesprek dat later volgde, zei de woordvoerster dat “het IDF de bewering niet officieel kan bevestigen maar men ervan uit kan gaan dat het werkelijk gebeurd is.”\nOok de Amerikaanse website Business Insider benaderde een woordvoerder van het IDF over de aanval van Hamas op Kfar Aza. Majoor Nir Dinar vertelde aan de nieuwssite dat Israëlische soldaten op die plaats lichamen van baby’s hebben aangetroffen die onthoofd waren. De woordvoerder zei niets over hoeveel baby’s er precies werden aangetroffen en hoeveel baby’s onthoofd waren.\nTenslotte is er ook volgens de Britse nieuwszender Sky News geen officiële bevestiging dat er veertig Israëlische baby’s onthoofd werden door leden van Hamas.\nMoeilijk te achterhalen wat op afbeelding te zien is\nDe foto die nu op sociale media als bewijs voor de bewering wordt gekoppeld, is grotendeels geblurd, waardoor het onmogelijk is om te achterhalen wat er precies op de afbeelding te zien is. Zo is het niet duidelijk of het gaat om lichamen van baby’s, kinderen of volwassenen. Ook kan niet met zekerheid afgeleid worden of de lichamen op de afbeelding onthoofd zijn.\nOnline is wel een andere versie van de afbeelding terug te vinden die minder, of slechts gedeeltelijk, geblurd is. Maar ook bij die foto is het moeilijk om een uitspraak te doen over wiens lichamen er te zien zijn en of die onthoofd zijn. De afbeelding die online rondgaat, kan dan ook niet dienen als bewijs dat Hamas veertig Israëlische baby’s onthoofd heeft bij de aanval op Kfar Aza.\nBovendien duikt de foto ook op in verontwaardigde posts zonder vermelding van onthoofde baby’s. Daarin is enkel sprake van verbrande lijken.\nPremier Netanyahu deelde andere afbeeldingen van verbrande babylijkjes\nPremier Netanyahu tweette op 12 oktober verschillende afbeeldingen van verbrande baby’s. Het bijschrift van die tweet luidde als volgt: “Dit zijn enkele van de foto's die premier Benjamin Netanyahu liet zien aan de Amerikaanse minister van Buitenlandse Zaken Antony Blinken. Waarschuwing: het zijn gruwelijke foto's van baby's die vermoord en verbrand zijn door de monsters van Hamas. Hamas is onmenselijk. Hamas is ISIS” (eigen vertaling).\nDe afbeelding die nu op sociale media gedeeld wordt, om aan te tonen dat leden van Hamas veertig baby’s onthoofd hebben, stond alvast niet tussen de afbeeldingen die premier Netanyahu bekendmaakte.\nPersagentschap Reuters kon alle beelden die Israël aan het Witte Huis toonde inkijken. Op geen enkele van die vrijgegeven beelden waren onthoofde baby’s te zien.\nConclusie\nOnline wordt beweerd dat Hamas veertig baby’s onthoofd heeft bij de aanval op Kfar Aza, een Israëlische kibboets nabij de Gazastrook. De aanleiding was een reportage van de Israëlische nieuwszender i24news. Maar het Israëlisch defensieleger (IDF) heeft zelf laten weten dat ze de bewering niet officieel kan bevestigen. Ook van de afbeelding die online rondgaat als bewijs hiervan kan niet afgeleid worden dat ze de onthoofde baby’s zouden tonen.",

    "maintext":"Op verschillende sociale media, zoals X en Reddit, wordt sinds 12 november een foto verspreid van een soldaat die voor een gebombardeerd gebouw zit aan een salontafel met koekjes en een koffietas. Deze foto zou volgens de berichten genomen zijn ergens in Gaza. Er heerst verontwaardiging bij de foto, bijvoorbeeld bij volgende X-gebruiker:\nScreenshot van Twitteraccount van WizardSX. Deze foto werd intussen meer dan 350.000 keer bekeken.\nOok in de reacties onder het bericht heerst verontwaardiging. “Triestig dat mensen hier blij van worden” en “dit is heel onrespectvol”, valt onder meer te lezen.\nEerdere valse beelden over conflict tussen Israël en Hamas\nDe huidige oorlog tussen Israël en Hamas brak uit op 7 oktober nadat Hamas verschillende doelwitten in Israël aanviel. Sinds 8 oktober voert Israël een continue stroom aan bombardementen uit op de Gazastrook. En sinds 27 oktober zette het Israëlisch defensieleger (IDF) ook een grondoffensief in. Een volledig overzicht van de gebeurtenissen valt hier te lezen.\nVolgens een artikel van Knack bracht het conflict een propagandaoorlog met zich mee langs beide strijdende kanten. Hierdoor circuleren heel wat beelden die nep zijn (zie bijvoorbeeld hier) of hergebruikt worden uit eerdere conflicten (zie bijvoorbeeld hier). Voor deze factcheck controleren we of de foto van de soldaat op de koffie in oorlogsgebied echt is.\nDe foto kent nog een andere, veel gedeelde versie\nWanneer we via een reverse image search via Google Lens zoeken op de afbeelding blijkt dat de er nog een andere versie van de foto bestaat zonder tafel met koekjes en zonder graffiti op de achtergrond. Martin Tuitero, een populair account dat oorlogsbeelden verifieerd, toont op X volgend beeld waarbij hij claimt dat zijn afbeelding de oorspronkelijke, onbewerkte foto is.\nScreenshot van de tweet met foto zonder graffiti en salontafel.\nOok op andere sociale media kanalen (zie hier en hier) wordt gesuggereerd dat de foto met de tafel fake zou zijn. Waar de foto voor het eerst gepost werd, konden we echter niet achterhalen. De oudste versies van de foto met en zonder tafel dateren allebei van 12 november. Op sociale media wordt wel herhaaldelijk verwezen naar Telegram wanneer het over de oorsprong van de foto gaat. Daar zijn beide foto’s ook terug te vinden (zie hier).\nDoordat we de oorspronkelijke bron niet kennen, kunnen we ook geen uitspraken doen over de identiteit van de man op de foto. Vermoedelijk gaat het, gezien de typische legeruitrusting, om een Israëlische soldaat.\nBeeldonderzoek toont dat de tafel hoogstwaarschijnlijk door AI werd toegevoegd\nOmdat beide versies van de foto op dezelfde dag (12 november) verschenen, en er geen oudere versies van de foto terug te vinden zijn, consulteren we dr. Hannes Mareen van het UGent-imec onderzoeksteam IDLab-MEDIA. Daar zijn ze gespecialiseerd in de analyse van beeldmanipulatie. Onderzoeker Mareen analyseerde beide afbeeldingen en concludeert dat de afbeelding met de tafel hoogstwaarschijnlijk vervalst is: “De vervalsing van de tafel gebeurde waarschijnlijk met behulp van generatieve AI. Van de blauwe graffiti zie ik echter geen duidelijke sporen van manipulatie, al lijkt het in de context het meest waarschijnlijk dat dit ook achteraf digitaal toegevoegd is.”\nDe vermoedelijke manipulatie is op het eerste zicht misschien niet geheel merkbaar, maar Mareen wijst op enkele zaken die visueel niet kloppen aan de afbeelding: “de plastic fles onder de voet van de soldaat lijkt te zweven en stopt abrupt halverwege, de tas heeft twee oortjes die niet symmetrisch zijn en de kleur van het zand dat door de onderkant van de tafel te zien is, is significant verschillend van het andere zand op de foto. Zulke vreemde fouten die op het eerste zicht juist lijken, maar bij diepere analyse geen steek houden, zijn vaak een teken van generatieve AI.”\nTen slotte levert Mareen ook bewijs aan voor zijn bevindingen aan de hand van een analyse met de beeldmanipulatiedetectie methode TruFor. Die analyse kan objectieve indicaties van manipulatie geven en wordt gebruikt door IDLab. Die toont dat de tafel op de heatmap afwijkt ten opzichte van de rest van de afbeelding. De TruFor analyse toont echter geen sporen van vervalsing over de graffiti in de achtergrond. Ten slotte gebruikte Mareen de TruFor analyse ook op de foto zonder tafel. Daaruit bleken geen duidelijke sporen van manipulatie.\nMareen wijst er echter ook op dat andere detectiemethoden (zie hier) geen duidelijke indicatie van manipulatie weergeven in de gebieden rond de tafel en graffiti. Daarom concludeert Mareen dat de afbeelding ‘hoogstwaarschijnlijk’ bewerkt werd met AI.\nConclusie\nDe foto van de Israëlische soldaat werd hoogstwaarschijnlijk bewerkt door generatieve artificiële intelligentie. Vreemde fouten, zoals een koffietas met twee oren en een zwevende fles, wijzen daarop. Ook een beeldmanipulatie-analyse op de afbeelding toont sporen van manipulatie bij de tafel. Bij de graffiti in de achtergrond waren echter geen sporen.",

    "maintext":"Een bijna surreële afbeelding van een vrouw die een verwoest huis afdaalt met enkel nog een speelgoedauto in de hand wordt veelvuldig verspreid op sociale media, vooral op X en Instragram. Op het X-account van de Amerikaanse politieke influencer Jackson Hinkle werd de afbeelding al meer dan een miljoen keer bekeken. Volgens het account zou dit om een Palestijnse vrouw gaan. “Je kan de Palestijnse geest niet breken”, schrijft Hinkle bij zijn bericht.\nScreenshot van de foto op het X-account van Jackson Hinkle.\nDeze factcheck gaat na of deze foto echt is en te maken heeft met het conflict in Israël.\nDe foto dateert van 2016 uit de burgeroorlog in Syrië\nEen reverse image search in de zoekmachine Tineye, een zoekmachine die de webgeschiedenis van afbeeldingen weergeeft, toont dat de afbeelding al terug te vinden was in 2020. Een van de zoekresultaten in Tineye brengt ons bij de sociaal netwerk site Imgur, waar afbeeldingen worden gedeeld onder gebruikers. Daar valt te lezen dat de naam van de afbeelding “Mother” is en dat het een foto betreft van de fotograaf Hassan Ghaedi tijdens het conflict in Syrië die werd getrokken in Homs, een stad in Syrië.\nDat wordt bevestigd door een reverse image search van de afbeelding in Google. Zo komen we bij de site van het SIPA (Siena International Photo Awards), een bekende internationale fotocompetitie. De foto waar wij naar op zoek zijn is daar ook terug te vinden. Het gaat effectief om een foto van Hassan Ghaedi, een Iraans fotojournalist, die met dez foto uit Homs in de prijzen viel in 2020.\nFoto op de website van Siena International Photo Awards.\nHassan deelde de foto zelf op zijn Instagrampagina in 2020. De foto werd wel al in 2016 genomen, aan het einde van gewelddadigste periode in de Syrische burgeroorlog, meldt Hassan op zijn Instagrampagina. Verder deelt Hassan mee dat de foto een Syrische vrouw toont die in 2016 terug naar huis komt en daar in het puin een speelgoedauto aantreft.\nDe erkende factcheckorganisaties Reuters en AFP bevestigden intussen dit onderzoek. Ook zij stellen dat de foto uit de oorlog in Syrië komt.\nHeel wat verspreiding van foutieve informatie tijdens de oorlog in Israël\nDat foutieve beelden uit de oorlog in Israël sterk circuleren is niet nieuw. Sinds die uitbraak van de oorlog op 7 oktober, nadat de terroristische organisatie Hamas verschillende doelwitten in Israël aanviel, volgde een heuse propagandaoorlog tussen beide partijen. Beelden van bombardementen, van grondoffensieven en andere militaire operaties passeren continue de revue. Vaak gaat het om beelden die nep zijn (zie bijvoorbeeld hier), maar soms gaat het ook om beelden die hergebruikt worden uit eerdere conflicten (zie bijvoorbeeld hier).\nConclusie\nDe foto van een vrouw die de trap afdaalt in een ingestort huis heeft niets te maken met de oorlog in Israël. De foto dateert namelijk al uit 2016 en werd genomen in Homs, een stad in Syrië, door de Iraanse fotojournalist Hassan Ghaedi. De foto won in 2020 een internationale prijs binnen een fotocompetitie.",

A gravação sobre a qual foram feitas as adulterações nos rostos é trecho de uma reportagem do SBT-MS.\nO conteúdo, verificado pelo Comprova, foi compartilhado sem qualquer aviso de que se tratava de um vídeo editado, em uma página de \"humor\" e \"notícias\" cujos posts já foram verificados outras vezes pelo Comprova.

    "maintext":"São Paulo\nDados do estudo do Observatório Infância, da Fiocruz, mostram que é falso que crianças têm Covid-19 de forma muito leve, ao contrário do que afirma post viral nas redes sociais. De acordo com a pesquisa, em 2020 e 2021, a doença causou a morte de 539 crianças de 6 meses a 3 anos de idade.\nSobre a ocorrência de pericardite e miocardite como efeitos adversos pós-vacinação, o conteúdo investigado pelo Comprova confunde ao não deixar claro que se tratam de ocorrências consideradas muito raras. Além disso, um estudo publicado no site do CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), dos Estados Unidos, mostrou que o risco de complicações cardíacas, incluindo miocardite e pericardite, foi significativamente maior após a infecção pelo vírus Sars-CoV-2, que provoca a Covid-19, do que após a aplicação da vacina entre pessoas com ao menos 5 anos.\nDiante da baixa incidência de miocardite e pericardite como evento adverso pós-vacinação, a última nota técnica do Ministério da Saúde sobre o tema, de número 139/2022, reforça o benefício da vacina em comparação com o risco de infecção por Covid-19 e desenvolvimento das formas graves da doença.\nCriança recebe vacina contra a Covid em São Paulo; em vídeo, médica engana ao sugerir que imunizantes provocam morte súbita, infarto e outros problemas - Bruno Santos - 20.jan.2022/Folhapress\nEm relação a outras complicações em crianças que, segundo a responsável pela gravação, seriam consequências da vacina —morte súbita, infarto, problemas neurológicos e catatonias musculares—, não há dados no boletim de monitoramento da segurança das vacinas, do Ministério da Saúde, que confirmem a alegação. A autora também não cita o que poderia embasar a alegação. Já sobre convulsão como possível evento adverso, a informação aparece (página 12) com uma incidência de menos de 0,06% a cada 100 mil doses aplicadas da vacina Pfizer/Wyeth e 0,03% a cada mil doses da Janssen —mas sem necessariamente ter relação de causalidade com a vacina comprovada.\nA responsável pelo vídeo também afirma que a bula da vacina pediátrica da Pfizer não indica que o imunizante foi testado em crianças menores de 5 anos. Mas o documento cita estudos clínicos em crianças a partir de 6 meses de idade. Em pessoas com 5 anos de idade ou mais, a miocardite e a pericardite são classificadas como eventos adversos \"muito raros\", com ocorrência em menos de 0,01% dos pacientes que usaram o imunizante.\nA reportagem fez contato com a médica Raissa Soares, autora do post, mas não houve retorno até a publicação desta verificação. Ela já teve diversas afirmações apontadas como desinformação.\nO Comprova considerou o conteúdo enganoso por trazer informações imprecisas sobre a vacinação infantil, distorcendo o que os dados oficiais e a bula da citada vacina apontam.\nPor que investigamos\nO Comprova monitora conteúdos suspeitos publicados em redes sociais e aplicativos de mensagem sobre políticas públicas e eleições no âmbito federal e abre investigações para aquelas publicações que obtiveram maior alcance e engajamento.

    "maintext":"Boato – Papa Francisco foi flagrado beijando Dalai Lama e tudo foi registrado em uma foto.\nAnálise\nTem circulado em perfis conservadores na internet (que não gostam dos posicionamentos do papa Francisco) uma suposta imagem que seria um “choque”. Na foto, o pontífice da Igreja Católica aparece beijando o líder do budismo Dalai Lama.\nNas versões que vimos do conteúdo, a imagem aparece de forma simples e pura e é apenas acompanhada de emojis. Veja uma das versões de fotos que vimos circulando por aí:\nChecagem\nA imagem (e algumas variáveis) causaram diversas reações nas pessoas. Porém, não é verdade que o papa Francisco foi flagrado beijando o Dalai Lama. Para elucidar o caso, vamos responder às seguintes questões: 1) A foto do papa Francisco beijando o Dalai Lama é real? 2) Como que a foto do papa Francisco e do Dalai Lama foi produzida? 3) Quais são os elementos que indicam que a imagem é falsa?\nA foto do papa Francisco beijando o Dalai Lama é real?\nNeste ano, o Dalai Lama (que é um cargo rotativo, aliás) proporcionou uma cena em público que escandalizou o mundo: nas imagens, ele pediu para um menino que estava em sua cerimônia “lamber a sua língua”. Apesar do escândalo, é falso que o papa Francisco tenha sido flagrado beijando o Dalai Lama.\nNão há qualquer registro em fontes confiáveis que mostrem que, de fato, houve o tal ocorrido. Para “ajudar”, é possível saber da origem da foto (e suas variáveis) que estão circulando na internet.\nComo que a foto do papa Francisco e do Dalai Lama foi produzida?\nNa realidade, a foto em questão é fruto de ferramentas de inteligência artificial (como, por exemplo, o Midjourney). Depois que o caso do Dalai Lama e a criança veio a público, diversos perfis (como este) geraram imagens artificiais para ilustrar a história. Entre os que geraram e os que copiaram, a história se espalhou.\nQuais são os elementos que indicam que a imagem é falsa?\nApesar de as ferramentas de geração de imagens estarem muito avançadas, é possível encontrar alguns erros. Na imagem que apreciamos, podemos encontrar algumas. Apesar de as pessoas serem parecidas com o papa Francisco e Dalai Lama, é possível ver que se trata de uma ilustração (o Dalai Lama, por exemplo, é muito mais jovem).\nAlém disso, o excesso de iluminação (parece que todas as pessoas têm um refletor no rosto) e deformações em membros nos mostra que se tratam de imagens feitas por IA. Além disso, conforme mencionamos, não há nada sobre o beijo em fontes confiáveis (se fosse real, seria mais um escândalo).\nConclusão\nFake news ❌\nÉ falso que o Francisco tenha sido flagrado beijando o Dalai Lama. A imagem que está circulando não passa de uma montagem e a história não passa de uma fake news.\nPs: Esse artigo é uma sugestão de leitores do Boatos.org.

    "maintext":"Boato – Cantora Ana Castela contou em entrevista a Danilo Gentili sobre seu novo investimento e foi processada pelo Banco do Brasil.\nAnálise\nSe o Boatos.org fizesse uma retrospectiva de 2023 nesse exato momento, com certeza teríamos um tipo de publicação em destaque: os golpes. Esse tipo de publicação enganou muita gente e causou diversos prejuízos financeiros.\nE a história de hoje mostra uma das publicações que mais circularam na internet esse ano. De acordo com ela, a cantora Ana Castela teria revelado em uma entrevista a Danilo Gentili seu novo investimento. Segundo a história, a revelação não teria agradado nada o Banco do Brasil, que teria decidido processar a cantora. Confira:\n“Por que o que Ana Castela disse ameaça a segurança financeira de todo o Brasil? Ela está sendo processada pelo Banco Nacional do Brasil por causa dessas palavras! Ana Castela não deveria ter mencionado isso, mas já era tarde demais. O escândalo estourou durante uma transmissão ao vivo, quando Ana Castela revelou acidentalmente seu segredo no programa. Muitos telespectadores, ao saberem das palavras “acidentais” de Ana Castela, começaram a enviar mensagens para o programa ao vivo. No entanto, o programa foi interrompido por uma ligação do Banco Central do Brasil, que exigiu que o programa fosse interrompido imediatamente.\n[…] Entrevista eliminada com Ana Castela, que todos os bancos receiam. Danilo Gentili: “Você é jovem e bem-sucedida, tem dinheiro e popularidade. Como você administra tudo isso?” Ana Castela: “Nem tudo na vida foi fácil para mim, exceto o dinheiro (risos). Você e eu já havíamos conversado sobre isso antes das filmagens.” Danilo Gentili: “O que me interessa é o seguinte: em uma conversa particular, você disse que ganhar dinheiro é fácil, principalmente nos dias de hoje. Portanto, quero que compartilhe esse conhecimento comigo e com nossos espectadores.” Ana Castela: “Eu não gostaria de revelar os detalhes de nossa conversa particular na TV ao vivo, porque se trata de minha renda. Hoje, ganho dinheiro com facilidade. Mas também cheguei a isso por conta própria e acho que as pessoas também devem procurar oportunidades por conta própria! É muito fácil ganhar dinheiro on-line hoje em dia…..”. Essa frase foi seguida de uma discussão entre a convidada e o apresentador do programa, durante a qual Ana Castela revelou acidentalmente a fonte secreta de sua renda.\nAna Castela: “Se não acredita, vou provar que está errado. Dê-me R$ 1200 e com esta plataforma Immediate ePrex XP, vou fazer milhão em apenas 12 a 15 semanas!”. Danilo Gentili: “Oh, ouvi dizer que há um programa que usa inteligência artificial para negociar criptomoeda. Todos os que nos estão a ver sabem como se chama.”. Ana Castela lamenta ter dito estas palavras ao vivo… Ana Castela: : “Estou pronto para pagar 20 000$ agora mesmo se cortar isto. Não queria dizer isso. Corte do ar. “ Danilo Gentili: “Para que saibam, este programa é AO VIVO. Todos os nossos telespectadores ouviram que está a enriquecer na plataforma Immediate ePrex XP . Já o revelou. Diga-nos, aos brasileiros comuns, como podemos ganhar dinheiro da mesma forma que o senhor. Ou os milionários não querem saber das pessoas comuns?” Ana Castela: “Pense nisso! Se todos sabem que podem se tornar milionários em poucos meses, por que continuar trabalhando? Sim, meu método está disponível para todos, mas se todos ficarem ricos, quem trabalhará em restaurantes, lojas ou fábricas?” Danilo Gentili: “Você realmente não se importa com seus fãs e com as pessoas comuns do Brasil? Você já falou, todo mundo sabe o nome dessa plataforma. Você deveria apenas nos contar mais sobre ela.” Ana Castela: “Realmente, não há nada a esconder. Vou lhe contar tudo, só preciso do seu número de telefone e 1200 reais.”\nAna Castela: “Acabei de te registar no Immediate ePrex XP no seu telefone. Esta plataforma é uma solução 100% perfeita para quem quer enriquecer rapidamente. Baseia-se numa inteligência artificial com auto-aprendizagem que negoceia criptomoeda em vez de si. Não tem de fazer nada. Ou seja, não precisa de compreender como funciona a bitcoin ou outras moedas digitais. Este programa determina a hora perfeita para comprar e vender ativos e conclui as transações sozinho. A vantagem é que não precisa de fazer nada. Basta fazer um depósito mínimo para poder negociar dinheiro e o programa vai funcionar sozinho. É a melhor solução para esquecer o trabalho e começar a viver uma vida despreocupada.”. Depois de um tempo. Ana Castela: “Lembre-se que há cerca de 20 minutos eu peguei no seu telefone, te cadastrei nesta plataforma e fiz o depósito mínimo que mencionei antes, que e de apenas R$ 1200. Agora, abra o aplicativo e veja por si mesmo quanto conseguiu ganhar em tão pouco tempo.” Danilo Gentili abriu a sua conta pessoal na plataforma Immediate ePrex XP e ficou espantado. Em apenas 20 minutos, o programa tinha feito 3 transações: 1 era insignificante, mas as outras duas tinham sido bem-sucedidas e gerado um bom lucro. O saldo aumentou de R$ 1200 para R$ 1367. Ana Castela: “Agora diga-me, honestamente, quanto ganhou nesses 20 minutos?” Danilo Gentili: “R$ 167 de lucro líquido. É incrível!”.\nA história não demorou para viralizar nas redes sociais, em especial, no Facebook e deixou muitas pessoas curiosas. Apesar disso, a história apresenta as principais características de fake news na internet, como o caráter vago, alarmista, a falta de fontes confiáveis e a ausência de notícias sobre o assunto em veículos de comunicação confiáveis.\nA partir daí, investigamos um pouco mais essa história e vamos te responder, em três questões, o porquê você não deve acreditar nessa balela: 1) Ana Castela revelou um investimento e está sendo processada pelo Banco Nacional do Brasil? 2) O que a Ana Castela falou na entrevista do Danilo Gentili? 3) O que acontece se a pessoa entrar no investimento anunciado na mensagem?\nChecagem\nAna Castela revelou um investimento e está sendo processada pelo Banco Nacional do Brasil?\nNão. Não existe nenhuma prova sobre isso. Ana Castela não falou nada sobre isso em sua entrevista ao apresentador Danilo Gentili. Além disso, se isso realmente fosse verdade, com certeza a notícia já estaria circulando por aí. Na verdade, toda essa história trata-se de um golpe e a fala de que o Banco do Brasil teria decidido processar Ana Castela serve como uma forma de trazer credibilidade à história (que é falsa). Se isso não bastasse, a história fala em Banco Nacional do Brasil e esse banco não existe.\nO que a Ana Castela falou na entrevista do Danilo Gentili?\nA cantora Ana Castela participou do programa The Noite, comandado por Danilo Gentili, no dia 2 de novembro de 2022. Na oportunidade, ela falou sobre seu apelido de “boiadeira”, contou sobre a vida pessoal, seu percurso até a fama, sobre a mistura de estilos em suas músicas (como o sertanejo, o eletrônico e o funk) e os casos de assédio que sofreu por parte de homens em seus shows. Em nenhum momento Ana Castela fala sobre investimentos.\nO que acontece se a pessoa entrar no investimento anunciado na mensagem?\nCom certeza vai entrar em uma furada! Se o tal investimento já usa elementos falsos e mentirosos para atrair clientes, então, você já deve imaginar como será o resultado caso coloque dinheiro nesse negócio. E vamos ressaltar mais uma vez: dinheiro não cai do céu. Toda proposta de dinheiro fácil deve acender um sinal de alerta, porque se fosse fácil assim, não haveria tanta gente passando necessidades básicas.\nConclusão\nGolpe ⚠️\nA cantora Ana Castela não falou sobre seu novo investimento em entrevista ao apresentador Danilo Gentili e nem está sendo processada pelo Banco do Brasil. Para começo de história, o texto fala em Banco Nacional do Brasil. Não existe nenhuma instituição financeira no país com esse nome. Além disso, Ana Castela não falou sobre investimentos em sua participação no programa The Noite, com Danilo Gentili. Por fim, essa história já é antiga e apenas os personagens são modificados. O texto é exatamente é igual e o que muda são apenas os artistas e o nome do tal investimento.\nPs: Esse artigo é uma sugestão de leitores do Boatos.org.

    "maintext":"Jeremy Hunt promised a national insurance cut in the autumn statement (Maja Smiejkowska/PA)\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt claimed that his autumn statement provided the “largest ever tax cut for workers”, while the Treasury said that it was “the largest ever cut to employee and self-employed national insurance”.\nEvaluation: Missing context\nWhile it is correct to say that this was the largest single decrease to the part of national insurance that workers pay, there have been larger cuts to both national insurance and income tax in the past.\nThe Chancellor’s claim of this being the biggest ever cut for workers is predicated on income tax not just affecting workers, while national insurance is only paid by people in work.\nThe claim is also based on the cut being to the part of national insurance that workers pay. In the past there have been larger cuts to the part of national insurance paid by employers.\nThe facts\nThe claim\nThere are several official versions of this claim.\nOn X, formerly Twitter, Mr Hunt said he had announced the biggest business tax cut “in modern history” and the “largest ever” tax cut for workers in his autumn statement on November 22.\nA graphic posted by the Conservative Party on X used similar language to say it was the “largest ever tax cut for workers from January 2024”.\nA tweet from the Treasury said it was “the largest ever cut to employee and self-employed national insurance.”\nA press release from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, said it was “the biggest tax cut on work since the 1980s.”\nThe Chancellor said in the Commons he would cut the 12% national insurance rate on earnings between £12,570 and £50,270 to 10%.\nHe said the two percentage point reduction in the main rate of employees’ national insurance will save someone earning £35,000 more than £450 and the change would benefit 27 million people.\n(PA Graphics)\nOther changes were made to national insurance for the self-employed.\nThe evidence\nThe claim that the autumn statement included the largest cut to national insurance ever appears to be correct, based on records from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).\nThe OBR’s Policy Measures Database spreadsheet shows the cost or benefit to the Government of tax policies, going back to 1970.\nThis database showed that, by OBR estimates, the decision in the 1982 budget to reduce the surcharge for national insurance will cost the Treasury around £9.84 billion in the tax year ending March 2028. This makes it the biggest single reduction in the amount of money that the Government gets from national insurance.\nThe decision in the autumn statement to cut three types of national insurance is set to cost the Treasury around £9.76 billion in the tax year ending March 2028.\nThis is a little lower than the impact of the 1982 cut but that policy move changed how much national insurance employers paid; the amount taken from workers was not altered, so the Chancellor is not counting that as a tax cut for employees.\nThe OBR document also shows that there have been 10 cuts to income tax in the past which were larger than Mr Hunt’s latest national insurance cut. The largest of these will cost £41.26 billion in 2028.\nHowever, income tax is levied on more than just workers – pensioners, some benefits claimants and landlords, among others, must pay it and therefore the Chancellor can claim past reductions in that tax were not cuts purely for workers.\nIs tax falling?\nWhile the Chancellor did announce big cuts to tax in his autumn statement, overall tax in the UK is increasing.\nAccording to the OBR, the proportion of tax to gross domestic product (GDP) will be 37.7% in the tax year ending 2029.\n(PA Graphics)\nThat is the highest since the Second World War, and 4.5 percentage points above where it was before the pandemic.\nMost of the increase is due to income tax revenues, which are rising because the Government has frozen the thresholds where new tax rates begin while nominal wages are rising – this is known as fiscal drag because it “drags” people into paying higher taxes as their wages increase.\nNominal wage growth means that wages are rising, but does not take into account that inflation might be rising quicker than wages.\nThe frozen thresholds mean that around four million workers who were not paying income tax before because they were not earning enough will start to pay the tax, while three million will be moved onto the higher rate.\nAccording to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the autumn statement gave back less than £1 for every £4 taken away due to tax threshold freezes since 2021.\nLinks\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt’s tweet (archived)\nHM Treasury tweet (archived)\nConservative Party tweet (archived)\nHansard record of autumn statement (archived)\nOBR policy measures database (archived)\nDepartment for Science, Innovation and Technology press release (archived)\nAutumn statement 2023 (archived)\nGov.uk page on income tax (archived)\nOBR economic and fiscal outlook (archived)\nIFS personal taxes and benefits (archived)\nAbout PA’s fact checks\nIf you have any suggestions for future fact checks, objections or comments, please send them to factcheck@pamediagroup.com, including any relevant links.

    "maintext":"Para leer en español, vea esta traducción de Google Translate.\nAt a campaign reception in Denver, President Joe Biden distorted some of the facts and the position of his predecessor:\nBiden claimed that the U.S. has the “lowest inflation rate of any major country in the world right now.” As of October, at least Italy and Canada reported lower inflation rates than the U.S.\nThe president claimed to have “cut the federal deficit” by making some corporations pay higher taxes. But the deficit in fiscal year 2023, when the tax went into effect, still increased.\nHe said that former President Donald Trump “is proposing …. cutting Social Security and Medicare.” But in January, Trump advised Republicans against cutting funding for the Social Security and Medicare programs.\nBiden said Trump’s “plan” was to end the Affordable Care Act, jeopardizing health insurance for 40 million people. But that worst-case-scenario figure is based on Trump not replacing the ACA with anything. He says he would replace it with something — though he has given no details on what that would be.\nThe president claimed that 100 million people with preexisting conditions have protections “only” because of the ACA. That’s the case only for those buying insurance on their own; before the ACA, employer plans couldn’t deny a policy based on health conditions.\nBiden made his remarks at a private residence on Nov. 28. He repeated some of the same claims in a speech the next day in Pueblo, Colorado. The president has stepped up his campaign appearances recently and has three fundraisers in Massachusetts on Dec. 5.\nInflation\nAt the Nov. 28 campaign event, Biden said that the U.S. has the “lowest inflation rate of any major country in the world right now.” But that’s not accurate, at least not according to the most recent data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — or the White House’s own calculations.\nOECD data as of October 2023 show that Italy and Canada — which are also members of the G7, a group of seven of the world’s most advanced economies — had lower year-over-year inflation rates than the U.S. While the U.S. inflation rate was 3.2% that month, Italy’s was 1.7% and Canada’s was 3.1%.\nIf the list were expanded to include other “advanced economies,” Denmark (0.1%), Belgium (0.4%), Latvia (2.1%) and Lithuania (2.8%) also had lower rates than the U.S., according to OECD figures as of October.\nEven by the White House’s latest figures, Biden’s claim was not exactly right.\nBecause of differences in how countries calculate inflation rates, the White House Council of Economic Advisers said it “assembles and constructs harmonized inflation data for G7 countries, allowing for more apples-to-apples inflation comparisons.”\nBut last month the CEA reported that inflation in the U.S. was “among the lowest” of major economies – not the lowest.\n“Measured on an apples-to-apples HICP basis to allow global comparisons, both core & headline U.S. inflation were among the lowest in the G7 in September, the latest month with complete G7 data,” the CEA wrote in a Nov. 14 thread on X, the platform once known as Twitter. HICP stands for Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices.\nThe language is notable because in June, the CEA had said “the U.S. now has the lowest 12-month harmonized inflation in the G7, both for overall and core inflation.”\nIn his Nov. 29 remarks, Biden also labeled some companies greedy for not lowering prices since inflation has been declining in the U.S.\n“Let me be clear: Any corporation that is not passing these savings on to the consumers needs to stop the … price gouging,” Biden said, noting that Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania calls it “Greedflation.”\nBut a decline in the year-over-year inflation rate doesn’t automatically mean lower prices, as Biden suggested.\nAs the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis wrote in August, inflation is the increase in the prices of goods and services over time, and deflation occurs when those prices start to go down.\nWhat the U.S. has been experiencing for the last year is known as disinflation, which is when the rate of inflation decreases but prices still go up – just at a slower pace. Prices wouldn’t be expected to go down until the year-over-year inflation rate is below zero, or negative, which has not happened.\nDeficits\nIn his Nov. 28 campaign speech, Biden continued to misleadingly claim that he reduced the deficit, which he attributed to raising taxes on corporations.\n“But by making sure they pay that 15% minimum tax, we paid for everything that we’ve proposed,” the president said. “We didn’t increase the debt. We cut the federal deficit. And we have more work to do.”\nBiden was referring to the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax that was included in the Inflation Reduction Act that he signed into law in August 2022. As the Congressional Research Service explains, the CAMT “applies to firms with an average of $1 billion or more in profits in any three-year period and to foreign-parented U.S. firms with profits of over $100 million if the aggregated foreign group has over $1 billion in profits.”\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation did estimate that the tax, which went into effect in January of this year, would reduce federal deficits by more than $222 billion over 10 fiscal years, including by roughly $35 billion in 2023.\nBut the national debt has continued to increase under Biden, and the final deficit for fiscal 2023, which ended on Sept. 30, increased to roughly $1.7 trillion, or about $320 billion more than the almost $1.4 trillion deficit in fiscal 2022.\nIn his Nov. 29 remarks, Biden claimed to have reduced the deficit by “over $7 billion,” when he meant to say “over $1 trillion,” according to a White House transcript that corrected the president’s statement.\nDeficits have declined from the record of $3.1 trillion in fiscal 2020, before Biden took office. But as we’ve explained, the primary reason that deficits went down by about $350 billion in Biden’s first year, and by another $1.3 trillion in his second, is because of emergency COVID-19 funding that expired in those years.\nBudget experts said that if not for more pandemic and infrastructure spending championed by Biden, deficits would have been even lower than they were in fiscal 2021 and 2022.\nSocial Security and Medicare\nBiden also claimed that Trump is pushing to cut Social Security and Medicare, which is the opposite of what Trump has said publicly.\nOn Nov. 28, Biden said, “Trump is proposing — and the MAGA Republicans — of cutting Social Security and Medicare.” In remarks the next day, the president said making sure that billionaires “pay their taxes” would allow the U.S. “to strengthen the Social Security and Medicare system instead of cutting them” like “Trump and Boebert want to do,” a reference to Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado.\nHowever, in January, when lawmakers were negotiating an increase in the federal debt limit, Trump, in a video message, warned Republicans not to make cuts to those two entitlement programs.\n“Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from Medicare or Social Security to help pay for Joe Biden’s reckless spending spree,” he said. “While we absolutely need to stop Biden’s out of control spending, the pain should be borne by Washington bureaucrats, not by hard-working American families and American seniors.”\nSome critics argue that Trump’s words cannot be trusted because of his past budget proposals. But on Medicare, those budgets included bipartisan ideas to reduce the growth of spending.\nFor example, in 2020 we wrote about Democratic claims that Trump’s budget for fiscal 2021 included cuts to Medicare and Social Security. While the proposal called for reductions in future Medicare spending, budget experts said that would not mean cuts in benefits. As for Social Security, we wrote that the budget proposed reductions to the Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income programs, but not to the Social Security retirement program.\nWe also wrote in 2019 about Democratic claims that Trump was “once again trying to ransack Medicare” with his budget for fiscal 2020.\nIn that case, Trump’s budget again called for reducing Medicare spending by hundreds of billions of dollars, largely by lowering payments to providers. In fact, some of Trump’s Medicare proposals were similar to cost-cutting measures that had been proposed by former President Barack Obama.\nBut Trump’s 2020 budget did propose changing out-of-pocket costs for Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, which we said would increase costs for some beneficiaries and decrease costs for others.\nScrapping/Replacing Obamacare?\nThe Affordable Care Act — once again — has become a focal point of the presidential campaign.\nAfter former President Donald Trump posted on social media that Republicans “should never give up” on terminating the ACA, or Obamacare, Biden resurrected talking points about what would happen to insurance coverage and preexisting condition protections if the ACA were repealed. The problem is, Trump claims he would replace the ACA with something else. The problem for Trump is that he hasn’t provided a plan, and he never released one while in office, either.\nThere’s support for the idea that whatever Trump might advocate wouldn’t be as comprehensive as the ACA and would lead to an increase in the uninsured and fewer protections for those with health conditions. But at the same time, Biden takes advantage of Trump’s vagueness to claim the former president wouldn’t replace the ACA with anything at all.\nWe’ll go through Biden’s statements and explain what Trump has supported in the past.\nIn Truth Social posts on Nov. 25 and 29, Trump said he was “seriously looking at alternatives” and would replace the ACA with something “MUCH BETTER.” (He made similar claims as president.) We asked his campaign for more details on what Trump’s health care plan might be, but we haven’t received a response.\nBiden broached the subject at his Nov. 28 campaign reception. “Let’s be clear about what the Affordable Care Act means. There are 40 million people in America today who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act,” Biden said. “His plan is to throw every one of them off that — that legislation. It would mean the number of uninsured African Americans would go up by 20 percent. Latinos would go up by 15 percent.”\nHe made the same claims in his speech the next day in Pueblo, Colorado.\nThe 40 million figure is the number of people who were enrolled, as of early 2023, in insurance plans on the ACA marketplace, or exchanges — where people buy their own coverage, mostly with the help of premium tax credits — and those with Medicaid coverage thanks to the ACA’s Medicaid expansion policies, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. For marketplace plans, the law, which Obama signed in 2010, provides tax credits to those earning between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. As of February, 91% of the 15.7 million people with marketplace plans qualified for tax credits.\nThe Medicaid expansion allows adults earning up to 138% of the poverty level to obtain coverage in states that have chosen to participate. Forty states, plus the District of Columbia, have implemented the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, the most recent being North Carolina.\nIf the ACA were eliminated, the number and rate of the uninsured would increase significantly. Some who would lose coverage could get insurance through another means, but the jump in the uninsured would likely be tens of millions of people. Most of those who got coverage under the Medicaid expansion would likely become uninsured without the law, according to the nonpartisan health policy research group KFF. A 2020 report by the Urban Institute estimated that a net 21.1 million people would become uninsured in 2022 if the ACA were scrapped. At the time, there were fewer Americans with coverage either on the ACA marketplace or through Medicaid expansion, so such an estimate would likely be higher today.\nAs for Biden’s figures for the increase in the number of the uninsured by race, his campaign pointed to that same Urban Institute report. It found much larger percentage increases for the uninsured rates. If the ACA were eliminated, the report said, the uninsured rate for Black Americans would increase from 11% to 20%, and for Hispanic people from 21% to 30%.\nAs we said, Trump claims he would replace the ACA, but he hasn’t said with what. He hasn’t released his own health care plan, but Republican bills he supported in 2017 would have increased the number of people without health insurance by millions, as we’ve explained before. One GOP House bill would have led to 24 million more uninsured by 2026, according to an analysis at the time by the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation. The House passed that bill, but it failed in the Senate, despite both chambers being controlled by Republicans then.\nIn 2017, Trump also supported a so-called “skinny” repeal bill in the Senate, which would have sent a placeholder bill, with only some changes to the ACA, to a conference committee with the House. The House and Senate would have had to agree upon final legislation. But that bill, which also would have increased the number of people without insurance, failed, too.\nIn a court case challenging the constitutionality of the ACA, the Trump administration argued the entire law should be nullified. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in 2021 that the plaintiffs lacked standing.\nIn a June 2019 interview with ABC News, while that lawsuit was working its way through the courts, Trump said he would be releasing a health care plan to replace Obamacare “in about two months.” But that didn’t happen.\nTrump’s record indicates he would likely support a replacement that would lead to fewer Americans having health insurance, and it raises questions about whether Trump will release a health care plan. But the Biden campaign fills in the blanks to claim Trump has a “plan” to get rid of the ACA without anything in its place.\nProtections for Those with Preexisting Conditions\nBiden repeated a misleading talking point about the ACA’s preexisting condition protections.\n“There are over 100 million people today who have — who have protections against preexisting conditions only for one reason: because of the Affordable Care Act. Trump wants to get rid of it,” Biden said at the campaign reception.\nAs we explained a few times during the 2020 campaign, the 100 million figure is an estimate of how many Americans not on Medicare or Medicaid have preexisting conditions. The ACA instituted sweeping protections for those with preexisting conditions, prohibiting insurers in all markets from denying coverage or charging more based on health status. But only those buying their own plans on the individual or nongroup market would immediately be at risk of being denied insurance.\nEven without the ACA, employer plans couldn’t deny issuing a policy — and could only decline coverage for some preexisting conditions for a limited period if a new employee had a lapse in coverage.\nAs of 2022, 20 million people, or about 6.3% of the U.S. population, got coverage on the individual market. It is the case that the ACA’s broad protections would benefit people who lost their jobs or retired early and found themselves seeking insurance on their own.\nAs for Trump, he has said he supports preexisting condition protections, but while in office, he worked to reduce the protections under the ACA in several ways, as we’ve written before. In the lawsuit mentioned above, the Trump administration initially argued that the ACA’s preexisting condition provisions would have to go if the suit were successful. The administration later backed the full invalidation of the law.\nThe 2017 GOP bill Trump supported would have included some, but not all, of the ACA’s protections. Trump also pushed the expansion of cheaper short-term health plans that wouldn’t have to abide by the ACA’s protections, including prohibitions against denying or pricing coverage based on health status.\nIn late September 2020, less than two months before Election Day, Trump signed an executive order that said “[i]t has been and will continue to be the policy of the United States … to ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice at affordable rates.” He said the order put the issue of preexisting conditions “to rest.”\nBut it didn’t. At the time, Karen Pollitz, who was then a senior fellow at KFF, told us the order was “aspirational” and had “no force of law.”\nWith this issue, too, Trump doesn’t have a plan that can be evaluated — and his record indicates he could support a plan that weakens the preexisting condition protections in the ACA. But Biden’s talking point suggests no plan means no protections, and it glosses over the fact that even without the ACA, employer policies still wouldn’t be able to deny insurance.",

    "maintext":"Warnung: Einige der in diesem Artikel verlinkten Seiten zeigen Aufnahmen einer Leiche.\nEin Beitrag eines israelischen Armeesprechers in den sozialen Netzwerken sorgt für Kritik. Es geht um ein Video, das angeblich zeigt, wie Palästinenser eine Puppe als ein totes Baby ausgeben. Der Armeesprecher spricht von «Fake Aufnahmen» - dass also mit einer Puppe mutmaßlich ein Opfer des Krieges in Gaza inszeniert würde. Was stimmt?\nBewertung\nZu sehen ist tatsächlich ein totes Baby. Das beweisen weitere Aufnahmen. Einem Fotografen zufolge entstanden sie nach einem israelischen Luftangriff auf den Gazastreifen am 1. Dezember. Eine Inszenierung mit einer Puppe liegt also nicht vor.\nFakten\nDie Behauptung wird zu mehreren Videos verbreitet. Eines zeigt einen Mann mit weißen Haaren, der ein in ein Tuch gewickelten, leblosen Körper eines Babys zeigt. In einem anderen Video ist eine Frau mit der Leiche im Arm zu sehen. Umstehende beobachten und fotografieren sie. Es fällt auf, dass das mutmaßlich getötete Baby die Augen starr geöffnet hat. Der Körper wirkt leblos. Einige Nutzerinnen und Nutzer, darunter der israelische Armeesprecher, schlussfolgern daraus offenbar, dass es sich um eine Puppe handeln müsse.\nVon den Geschehnissen gibt es weitere, zum Teil besser aufgelöste Aufnahmen. Ein Nutzer veröffentlichte am 1. Dezember ein Reel auf Instagram. Es zeigt ebenfalls den Mann und das Baby. In dem kurzen Video ist zum Beispiel zu sehen, wie der Kopf des Kindes zur Seite kippt, wenn er nicht gestützt wird. Das spricht klar gegen eine angebliche Puppe.\nEs gibt zudem Fotos, auf denen das tote Baby genauer zu erkennen ist (hier, hier und hier). Ein Fotograf der staatlichen türkischen Nachrichtenagentur Anadolu hat sie gemacht. Sie zeigen, dass sich Teile des Gesicht des Kindes, zum Beispiel der Mund, leicht verformen, wenn der Körper unterschiedlich gehalten wird. Auch das zeigt, dass es sich nicht um eine Puppe handelt.\nGenaue Todesursache ist unklar\nAlle Aufnahmen sind sehr wahrscheinlich nur wenige Stunden nach dem Tod des Kindes entstanden, denn sonst wäre bereits eine Leichenstarre zu erkennen. Was genau die Todesursache war, lässt sich anhand der Bilder nicht beurteilen. Der Fotograf stellt in einem Beitrag auf Instagram einen Bezug zu israelischen Luftangriffen her. Der Mann in den Videos spricht auf Arabisch von Beschuss durch Panzer und Artillerie und erhebt Vorwürfe gegen Israel.\nDer Fotograf schreibt außerdem, dass er das Foto am 1. Dezember 2023 gemacht habe. Bei dem Baby handele es sich um einen fünf Monate alten Jungen. Außerdem seien die Mutter und der Großvater zu sehen. Die wortgleiche Bildbeschreibung findet sich auch auf der Plattform von Getty Images, auf der die Fotos von Anadolu angeboten werden.\nDer Aufnahmeort ist demnach ein Krankenhaus in der Stadt Deir al-Balah im zentralen Gazastreifen. Das passt zu einem der Videos: Im Hintergrund sieht man eine rote Markise und eine Klimaanlage über einem Schild an der Wand, die auch auf anderen Aufnahmen der Klinik zu sehen sind.\nAm 1. Dezember gab es nach dem Ende einer Feuerpause wieder Kämpfe im Gazastreifen, darunter israelische Luftangriffe. Laut palästinensischen Angaben war davon auch Deir al-Balah betroffen.\nIsraelische Zeitung löschte Artikel mit falschem Vorwurf\nDie Falschbehauptung über eine angebliche Puppe war kurz nach dem Auftauchen der Bilder und Videos unter anderem von der israelischen Zeitung «Jerusalem Post» verbreitet worden. Ein entsprechender Artikel wurde jedoch wieder gelöscht. Die Zeitung schrieb auf X, dass sie einen Artikel gelöscht habe, der nicht ihren redaktionellen Standards entsprochen habe.\n(Stand: 5.12.2023)",

Mit dem klebrigen Protest wollten die Umweltschützer von Greenpeace auf den klimaschädlichen Ölverbrauch aufmerksam machen.\nFakten\nMehrere Medien berichteten über die Aktion am 27. November (hier oder hier). Auslöser war der Autogipfel, denn im Straßenverkehr fallen laut Greenpeace fast zwei Drittel des klimaschädlichen Ölverbrauchs an.\nDie Klimaaktivisten protestierten nach eigenen Angaben «gegen die auto- und ölfixierte Verkehrspolitik». Sie forderten den Ausstieg aus fossilen Energien. Auf der Kurznachrichtenplattform X – ehemals Twitter – schrieben sie: «Gesucht: Klimakanzler. Gefunden: Öl-Olaf in Lobbygesprächen mit den Chefs von Volkswagen, BMW und Mercedes-Benz.»\nUm ihren Aussagen Ausdruck zu verleihen, platzierten die Aktivisten vor dem Kanzleramt in Berlin ein großes rotes Fass mit den Logos der drei Automarken. Aus dem Fass floss eine dunkle Flüssigkeit, die wie Öl aussah. Tatsächlich handelte es sich aber nach Angaben von Greenpeace um Melasse, die das Öl nur symbolisieren sollte. Die klebrige Flüssigkeit bestand aus Zuckerrohr und war somit ungefährlich für die Umwelt.\nDie Berliner Feuerwehr bestätigte auf Anfrage der Deutschen Presse-Agentur (dpa), dass sich die Substanz bei ihrem Einsatz vor Ort nicht als Öl herausstellte. Die Masse konnte demnach mit einem Bindemittel abgebunden werden. Eine Sprecherin der Polizei Berlin erklärte im Gespräch mit dpa, dass es sich bei der Flüssigkeit «nach jetzigem Kenntnisstand um Zuckerrohr» handelte. Der Nachrichtenseite «t-online» bestätigte die Polizei darüber hinaus, dass sich die dickflüssige Masse mit Wasser wegspülen ließ.\n(Stand: 04.12.2023)",

    "maintext":"Old video of Palestinian child being detained shared as recent\nBy: Vivek J\nDecember 5 2023 Share Article:\nScreenshots of the viral posts purporting to show a video of Israeli forces detaining a Palestinian kid. (Source:X/TikTok/Modified by Logically Facts)\nFact-Check The Verdict Misleading This video is from March 2018, when Israeli forces briefly detained a three-year-old under charges of stone pelting. Claim ID ba5cf10b\nWhat is the claim?\nThe ongoing Israel-Hamas war has resulted in the deaths of about 15,000 people in Gaza and Israel combined. Amid this, a video of Israeli security officials detaining a Palestinian child has been shared on social media. The caption of one such post shared on X (formerly Twitter) read, “The invincible army is trying to arrest a two-year-old Palestinian child!!!” The posts did not report when or where this incident took place (archives are here and here).\nScreenshots of the social media posts with a video showing Israeli troops detaining a two/three-year-old kid. (Source: X/Screenshots)\nSubsequently, several other social media users have shared the same video, linking it to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, along with hashtags like #Palestine, #Gaza, #Gazawar, #IsraelHamas, and so on. The implication is that the incident took place recently and during the ongoing war (archives of such posts are here, here, here, and here).\nScreenshots of the social media posts linking the viral video to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. (Source: TikTok/Screenshot/Modified by Logically Facts)\nHowever, this video is old and unrelated to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\nWhat we found\nWe conducted a reverse image search of multiple keyframes of the viral video and found the video uploaded on YouTube by an Israeli outlet, Haaretz, and Middle East Eye. These videos were uploaded in late March 2018. The caption of the Haaretz video read, “A three-year-old Palestinian boy was detained for a few minutes in Hebron by the police.” Hebron is a Northern Israeli city in the West Bank area.\n(Source: YouTube)\nResearching the two YouTube videos through Google led us to news articles reporting the March 2018 incident, including the Haaretz article. It noted that “Border Police officers detained a three-year-old Palestinian boy for a few minutes in Hebron on Tuesday. The police say the boy was sent to throw stones at the officers and then ran at them with a screwdriver and peeler in his hands, calling it a planned provocation.” It further noted that the boy was released shortly after.\nSimilarly, another article by Turkey-based Daily Sabah, dated March 28, 2018, also reported the incident in the northern Israeli city of Hebron. Daily Sabah shared the now-viral video on its X account on March 29, 2018. This shows that there was indeed an incident where a three-year-old boy was detained by the Israeli border Police and later released. This, however, is not related to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.\n(Source: X)\nSince the war broke out between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, there have been numerous reports of people (including children) being detained or arrested by the Israeli forces in the West Bank region.\nThe verdict\nThe video claiming to show Israeli forces arresting a two-year-old boy is from 2018. This video that shows Israeli border police briefly detaining a three-year-old boy is shared out of context, linking the incident to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.",

    "maintext":"Video of a Sri Lankan ship shared to claim Yemen bombed an Israeli ship\nBy: Soham Shah\nDecember 5 2023 Share Article:\nPost claiming that Yemen has bombed an Israeli ship. (Source: X/Modified by Logically Facts)\nFact-Check The Verdict False The video shows a ship burning off the coast of Sri Lanka in 2021 and is unrelated to both Israel and Yemen. Claim ID 7cc19858\nWhat is the claim?\nMultiple posts have been shared on social media X (formerly Twitter) with the claim that Yemen has bombed an Israeli ship. One such post carried the caption, “Yemen bombed the Israeli cargo ship \"Unity Explorer\" American military ships and other Western bases came to Djibouti trying to rescue the Israeli cargo ship Unity Explorer, which has now sunk in the Red Sea.” Archive links to such posts can be found here, here, and here.\nX posts claiming that Yemen has bombed an Israeli ship. (Source: X/Modified by Logically Facts)\nThese posts are being shared in relation to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in which over 1,200 Israelis were killed by Hamas in an attack on October 7, 2023, and over 15,200 Gazans have been killed by Israel in retaliation.\nReuters reported on December 4, 2023, that Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed to have attacked two ships in the Red Sea. One of these ships was named Unity Explorer, the same as in the posts. Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari confirmed in the report that the ships have no connection to Israel. The Houthis have, in the past, fired drones and ballistic missiles at Israel.\nOn researching, we found the viral video is unrelated to the alleged attack on the Unity Explorer and shows a May 2021 incident off the coast of Sri Lanka.\nWhat is the truth?\nCNN Indonesia posted a longer video showing similar visuals on May 26, 2021. The video, a compilation of clips, reportedly showed a Singapore-registered vessel that had caught fire off the coast of Sri Lanka’s Colombo on May 20, 2021. The report, Google translated from Indonesian, showed that a more intense fire followed on May 24, owing to the presence of chemicals on the ship. At the 0:24 mark of the CNN video, the visuals match the viral video.\nCNN Indonesia published a video with the same visuals. (Source: Screenshot/CNN)\nA 45-second video uploaded to X by the Sri Lankan Daily Mirror on May 26, 2021, also closely matched the viral video. \"Debris washes ashore at Negombo from the burning X-Press Pearl ship,\" the post read.\nPost from the Daily Mirror. (Source: X)\nOther publications like the BBC also posted various other visuals of the burning ship.\nBBC video. (Source: YouTube)\nAccording to The Guardian, the fire broke out on May 20, 2021, aboard the MV X-Press Pearl, a 25-person crew boat. While the crew was evacuated, the fire on the ship - which was carrying chemicals like nitric acid sodium hydroxide and 300 tonnes of fuel in its tanks - burned for over 10 days. The Indian and Sri Lankan navies were involved in dousing the fire. The incident caused significant environmental damage to air, ocean water, and beaches, and fishing was banned in a 50-km radius around the site of the burning ship.\nThe verdict\nWe have marked this claim as false as the video is from 2021, and the ship was Singapore-registered and not Israeli. Neither Houthi rebels nor Yemen were in any way connected.",

    "maintext":"\"Een waterval van leugens\" en \"een zwart gat van tegenstrijdigheid met zichzelf\". Zo zou de psychiater van Netanyahu de Israëlische premier omschreven hebben, voordat hij zichzelf in 2010 het leven nam. Althans, zo klinkt het verhaal op sociale media in onder andere deze post van begin november. Maar is er wel bewijs dat deze psychiater ooit heeft bestaan?\nBeoordeling\nNee, deze zogenaamde psychiater heeft nooit bestaan, laat staan zich het leven genomen omwille van Netanyahu. Het verhaal is afkomstig van een online satirisch artikel uit 2010. De auteur van het artikel bevestigde dit recentelijk opnieuw.\nFeiten\nHet bericht over de psychiater wordt via vele kanalen gedeeld, waar ook de naam van de zogenaamde psychiater wordt genoemd: Moshe Yatom. Hij zou in Tel Aviv werkzaam zijn geweest.\nOp zoek naar het verhaal, zijn alleen berichten over Yatoms zogenaamde zelfmoord te vinden en inmiddels al meerdere factchecks die het verhaal ontkrachten. Er duiken geen bewijzen op die aantonen dat hij daadwerkelijk heeft bestaan en als psychiater werkzaam was in Tel Aviv.\nDoor in Google verder te zoeken aan de hand van de naam Moshe Yatom naar resultaten verder in het verleden, wordt duidelijk dat de eerste versie van het verhaal in juni 2010 op de site legalienate verscheen. Volgens de website zelf publiceert ze \\'nieuws, commentaar en satire\\'. Als dat laatste is de tekst over de fictieve Moshe Yatom dan ook te lezen.\nDat het om een satrisch stuk gaat, bevestigde recentelijk de auteur van de tekst, Michael K. Smith, nog eens aan de Associated Press (AP). \"Het doel ervan was om op een onderhoudende manier aandacht te vestigen op de hopeloze waanzin van het Israëlische beleid\", liet hij het Amerikaanse persbureau schriftelijk weten.\nNieuw leven door AI\nHet satirische verhaal is dus in 2010 bedacht en ging onder andere in 2014 al rond in het Nederlands op Facebook.\nVorige maand werd het neppe verhaal nieuw leven ingeblazen op de Pakistaanse website Global Village Space. Volgens News Guard maakt de Pakistaanse website gebruikt van kunstmatige intelligentie (AI) om content te herschrijven, en hebben ze dat in dit geval ook gedaan. Er werd in het artikel niet duidelijk gemaakt dat het om satire ging.\nInmiddels heeft Global Village Space de titel van de tekst op haar website aangepast: daar staat nu helder dat de tekst satirisch is. Dat neemt niet weg dat het verhaal de afgelopen maand door velen op het internet voor waar aangenomen is.\n(Stand van zaken: 05.12.2023)",

    "maintext":"Depuis fin novembre 2023, des publications devenues virales sur les réseaux sociaux affirment que l'UE plancherait sur « une nouvelle loi » prévoyant de « saisir » et « mettre au rebut votre voiture » si celle-ci ne répond pas à certains critères.\n« Tout cela fait partie de leur programme climatique. L'Etat décidera pendant combien de temps vous serez autorisé à posséder votre voiture », prétendent ces messages partagés des milliers de fois en plusieurs langues sur les plateformes X (ancien Twitter), Facebook et Telegram ainsi que sur certains blogs.\nMais ces allégations sont-elles fondées ? Qu'en est-il exactement de la proposition sur la table ?\nÉvaluation\nCes affirmations sont fausses. La Commission européenne propose de réviser la législation sur les « véhicules hors d’usage » (VHU) afin d'améliorer leur collecte et leur recyclage. Il n'est pas question de saisir les voitures des particuliers, et encore moins d'imposer une quelconque durée de possession d'une voiture.\nFaits\nLa rumeur, initialement partagée en anglais sur X, a été largement relayée par des comptes et groupes qui relativisent le réchauffement climatique.\nDébut juillet 2023, la Commission européenne a proposé de revoir la législation sur les véhicules hors d'usage. L'objectif est d'améliorer la collecte, le traitement et le recyclage de ces véhicules ainsi que de faciliter l'accès de l'économie européenne à certaines ressources.\nAlors que chaque année, plus de six millions de véhicules arrivent en fin de vie en Europe, la proposition de règlement suggère également d'accroître la réutilisation de matériaux recyclés dans les voitures neuves et de réduire le nombre de VHU manquants, notamment en interdisant l'exportation hors d'Europe de ceux n'étant plus jugés aptes à circuler. En l'absence de traitement adéquat, les VHU sont en effet classés comme des déchets dangereux.\nSelon les prévisions de la Commission européenne, les actions proposées devraient permettre de réduire les émissions de CO2 de 12,3 millions de tonnes d'ici à 2035, de mieux valoriser 5,4 millions de tonnes de matériaux et de récupérer davantage de matières premières critiques (comme le cuivre, le lithium, le cobalt, etc. utilisés dans les batteries électriques, par exemple).\nNouvelles obligations pour l'industrie\nIl n'est toutefois pas question pour l'UE de « saisir », ni de « mettre au rebut » les véhicules des particuliers, contrairement à ce qu'avancent les publications relayées sur les réseaux sociaux.\nOn ne trouve trace de ces affirmations nulle part dans la proposition de règlement (disponible ici) de la Commission européenne.\nLe texte impose, en revanche, de nouvelles obligations aux constructeurs automobiles, aux centres de traitement des véhicules et aux Etats membres, chargés de veiller au respect de ces nouvelles exigences.\nLes particuliers, quant à eux, ne sont concernés que par l'article 26. Celui-ci stipule que les détenteurs de VHU doivent remettre leur véhicule à une installation de traitement agréée et fournir un certificat de destruction le cas échéant. Le texte n'établit, cependant, aucun délai. Les propriétaires restent libres de décider quand ils s'en débarrassent.\nL'irréparabilité comme critère principal\nDans l'annexe I de la proposition de règlement, la Commission européenne définit les conditions déterminant si un véhicule est hors d'usage.\nPour être considéré comme tel - et non comme un véhicule d'occasion - celui-ci doit être techniquement ou économiquement « irréparable ».\nCela peut être notamment le cas si le véhicule est « découpé en morceaux », « complètement brûlé » ou s'il a été « immergé dans l'eau », précise le texte.\nUn véhicule sera également considéré comme « irréparable » et donc hors d'usage si sa valeur marchande est inférieure au coût des réparations nécessaires pour le remettre dans un état technique suffisant pour pouvoir circuler dans l'Union européenne.\nAutre cas de figure : un véhicule d'occasion pourrait être qualifié de VHU si son propriétaire est inconnu, s'il ne peut être identifié par aucun moyen ou s'il n'a pas fait l'objet d'un contrôle technique obligatoire depuis plus de deux ans, par exemple. Ces critères ne sont toutefois mentionnés qu'à titre indicatif, ils n'ont aucune valeur contraignante.\nAffirmer - comme le font les publications examinées - que l'UE pourrait saisir une voiture et la mettre au rebut « si son coût de réparation dépasse sa valeur » ou « si elle n'a pas passé de contrôle régulier pendant deux ans », est donc totalement faux. Il s'agit de bribes de texte sorties de leur contexte.\nPasseport circulaire\nLes publications évoquent par ailleurs l'introduction d'un passeport circulaire.\nSi ce dernier élément est correct, le rôle de ce passeport est uniquement d'informer sur « la manière d'extraire et de remplacer en toute sécurité les pièces et composants des véhicules » selon les méthodes et technologies existantes, précise l'article 13.\nCe document concerne au premier chef les constructeurs automobiles et centres de traitement.\nProchaines étapes\nLes mesures proposées par la Commission européenne n'en sont, en outre, qu'au stade de proposition de règlement.\nLe texte doit encore être examiné par le Parlement européen et le Conseil dans le cadre de la procédure législative ordinaire, qui peut prendre plusieurs mois.\n(Situation au 05.12.2023)",

    "maintext":"Old footage of ISIS execution shared as Hamas pushing hostages off a building\nBy: Annet Preethi Furtado\nDecember 5 2023 Share Article:\nScreenshots of a video claiming to show Hamas executing hostages by throwing them off the roof of a building. (Source: X/Screenshot/Modified by Logically Facts)\nFact-Check The Verdict False The video reportedly depicts ISIS executing men accused of homosexuality in Iraq’s Fallujah and is at least eight years old. Claim ID 2eddd1e4\n(Trigger warning: This story and the video it cites depict violence. Logically Facts has refrained from including the distressing visuals.)\nContext\nDuring the recent seven-day ceasefire amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, the Israeli government confirmed the release of 13 Israeli hostages on November 24, 2023. This brought the total number of freed civilians to 105, including 81 Israelis, 23 Thais, and one Filipino. As part of the arrangement, Israel released 210 Palestinian security prisoners, according to a report by the Times of Israel.\nIsraeli authorities also claimed that they had identified the body of one of the hostages captured by Hamas at the start of the conflict. Four other hostages – Eliyahu Margalit, Maya Goren, Ronen Engel, and Arye Zalmanovich – were also confirmed dead, according to Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesperson, as reported by Reuters.\nWhat’s the claim?\nAmid news of the death of the hostages, a viral video on social media allegedly depicts Hamas executing people by throwing them off the roof of a building. The 45-second video shows two people atop a four-story building, who push people off the top one by one.\nThe video was widely shared on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), with the caption: \"Hamas executes people by throwing them off a building\\'s roof.\" One such post on X has amassed around 16.9k views at the time of writing.\nScreenshot of viral X posts. (Source: X/Screenshot/Modified by Logically Facts)\nSimilarly, on Facebook, users have shared the video with the caption, \"Here are your poor Palestinians. Hamas executes people by throwing them off a roof of a building!\"\nScreenshots of viral Facebook posts. (Source: Facebook/Screenshot/Modified by Logically Facts)\nHowever, the video is not related to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, as claimed in the viral posts.\nWhat\\'s the truth?\nA reverse image search of the video\\'s keyframes reveals that the footage dates back to at least July 2015 and depicts ISIS executing men accused of homosexuality in Iraq’s Fallujah. It is not related to Palestine or Hamas.\nOn July 1, 2015, MEMRI (Middle East Media Research Institute), a non-profit based in Washington, published a report headlined: \"ISIS In Iraq Executes More Homosexuals By Casting Them From A Rooftop (Warning: Graphic Images).\" The report states that on July 1, 2015, the Islamic State (ISIS) media office in Iraq\\'s Fallujah province published photos showing the execution of four men convicted of engaging in homosexual acts. Notably, one of the images in this report closely resembles the building structures seen in the viral video.\nLebanon Debate, a news website specializing in Lebanese affairs, and the British website Mirror also covered this 2015 incident, noting the victims were pushed off the roof of a building in Fallujah, Iraq, by ISIS militants.\nThe Lebanon Debate report stated that the victims were bound and blindfolded, then taken to the roof of a building and thrown off. It also reported that in contrast to usual ISIS practices, there were no onlookers, including civilians or members of the organization, present at the scene to witness the execution.\nVisual cues in the video\nWe cross-referenced an image from the news report with a frame from the viral clip. An image in the Mirror article showed the same structure of the roof and similarly-styled windows, as those seen in the viral video. MEMRI and Lebanon Debate also carried this image.\nIn the image from the news article, a man is observed standing on the ground floor near a closed shutter of a shop. In the viral video, this individual becomes visible as he walks from one side of the frame to the other, starting at the 0:18-second mark. Notably, a parked car on the left side of the frame also becomes evident, matching the one in the viral video.\nComparison of an image from the Mirror report to the viral clip (Source: X/Mirror/Screenshots/Modified by Logically Facts)\nWhile Logically Facts could not independently verify if the video shows ISIS men or if it is from Iraq, multiple reports confirm that the extremist group had shared these photos. Further, as they date back to at least July 2015, they cannot be related to the Israel-Hamas conflict.\nThe verdict\nThe video, purportedly showing an ISIS execution in Fallujah, Iraq, has been incorrectly circulated as depicting Hamas executing hostages during the Israel-Hamas conflict. This claim is false, as the video is old and unrelated to Palestine or Hamas.",

    "maintext":"Update (29 December 2023): The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), through a press release on 28 December 2023, has informed that that the sentences of eight former Indian Navy personnel on death row have been reduced in the Dahra Global case. The detailed judgement is awaited.\nA post is being shared on social media claiming that Qatar had revoked the death sentence awarded to eight Indians. The post claims that the Qatar government prioritized the friendship with Narendra Modi and India over the severity of the criminal offences allegedly committed by the eight Indians. In the wake of the Qatar Court of First Instance announcing the death penalty to eight former Indian Navy personnel in October 2023 on charges of allegedly spying for Israel, the post is going viral on social media. Let’s verify the claim made in the post.\nClaim: Qatar quashed the death sentence of eight Indians prioritising the friendship with Narendra Modi and India. Fact: The appellate court in Qatar recently accepted the appeal filed against the death sentence awarded to eight former personnel of the Indian Navy. However, the case is still pending and the next hearing of this case is scheduled on 07 December 2023. The Qatar judiciary as on date did not make any announcement regarding the cancellation of the death penalty of eight former Indian Navy personnel. Hence, the claim made in the post is False.\nWhen we searched to check whether the Qatar Court had revoked the death sentence given to the eight former Indian Navy personnel, allegedly accused of spying for Israel, we could not find any official news reports confirming the quashing of the death sentence of eight Indians. If Qatar had quashed the death sentence of eight Indians, several news websites would have published articles reporting that information.\nThe appellate court in Qatar has accepted the appeal filed by the Indian government against the death sentence awarded to the eight former personnel. This reportedly took place almost two weeks after the Indian government had said that the appeal had been filed in the case. However, the Ministry of External Affairs did not make any announcement regarding the quashing of the death penalty given to eight Indian citizens.\nAbhinandan Mishra, a journalist from Dainik Bhaskar, tweeted that the upcoming hearing for this case is set to take place on 7 December 2023. Speaking to ‘Boom Live’ about the viral social media post alleging the cancellation of the death sentence to eight former Indian Navy personnel, Abhinandan Mishra said, “Not true as far as I am aware. The case is still being heard in the court.”\nThe next hearing has been scheduled for 7 December. Indian officials, meanwhile, will be meeting the eight Indians soon. https://t.co/sNRSn86iFG — Abhinandan Mishra (@mishra_abhi) December 2, 2023\nTo sum it up, Qatar did not revoke the death sentence issued to the eight former Indian Navy personnel.",

Fact: The Israel Defence Force has not made such remarks against India on Twitter. Hence, the claim made in the post is False.\nTo check the claim’s veracity, we performed a keyword search on the internet to see if any media outlets have reported the Israel Defence Force making such a statement on India through X (formerly Twitter). This yielded no credible news reports supporting the viral claim.\nWe further checked the official verified X handle of the Israel Defence Force to see whether they made such a tweet on the said date, i.e. 15 May 2021. We found no such tweet on their page. This makes it clear that the viral screenshot of the alleged tweet is Fake and most probably a graphic created using digital graphic designing tools like Photoshop, illustrator, etc. Furthermore, speaking to the fact-checking website ‘CHECKYOURFACT’, an IDF spokesperson refuted the viral claim by labelling it as “Completely False.”\nTo sum up, this purported tweet of the Israel Defence Force making derogatory remarks against India is fake.",

De acordo com o texto, ele teria ameaçado o Brasil.\nMilei teria dito que não pagaria o Brasil ao dinheiro dado pelo governo Lula presidente da Argentina (ele ainda é) Sérgio Massa. A mensagem aponta que o valor seria de US$ 1,2 bilhão e chamado o governo brasileiro de corrupto. Leia o texto contido na mensagem:\nJavier Milei: “Não temos responsabilidade alguma sobre dinheiro dado ao ‘Sergio Massa’ pelo governo brasileiro, não foi um dinheiro emprestado ao povo argentino e sim a uma cúpula corrupta para interferir nas eleições” “US$:1,2 bilhão” <<<<6 bilhões de reais>>>>\nChecagem\nNa parte da checagem do conteúdo, vamos responder às seguintes questões:1) É verdade que Javier Milei disse a frase em questão? 2) Javier Milei fez alguma ameaça em relação à dívida da Argentina ao Brasil? 3) Há outras informações falsas contidas na mensagem sobre o Brasil e a Argentina?\nÉ verdade que Javier Milei disse a frase em questão?\nNão é verdade. Procuramos por qualquer registro de que o presidente da Argentina teria feito a tal declaração. Apesar de ter acusado Sérgio Massa de ter “recebido ajuda do Brasil” durante as eleições, não falou em valores ou sobre não pagar o Brasil.\nJavier Milei fez alguma ameaça em relação à dívida da Argentina ao Brasil?\nMilei, de fato, fez várias acusações contra “países comunistas”. Porém, em nenhum momento disse que não “pagaria dívidas” de US$ 1,2 bilhão do Brasil. Dívida, aliás, que não existe.\nHá outras informações falsas contidas na mensagem sobre o Brasil e a Argentina?\nNão há como a Argentina ficar devendo US$ 1,2 bilhão ao Brasil porque o Brasil não fez nenhum tipo de empréstimo neste valor. Na realidade, a Argentina contraiu um empréstimo com a China e, ao contrário do que aponta a história, o Brasil não foi avalista ou fez o empréstimo.\nConclusão\nFake news ❌\nÉ falso que Javie Milei disse que a Argentina não vai pagar o valor de US$ 1,2 bilhão ao governo brasileiro. Não houve o tal empréstimo de Lula a Sérgio Massa e o presidente eleito do país não anunciou o “calote”.\nPs: Esse artigo é uma sugestão de leitores do Boatos.org.

Em seguida, ele canta o clássico dos Beatles Michelle. O vídeo também contêm montagens de ele cantando e das imagens do “casal Bolsonaro” (Jair e Michelle). Leia as mensagens que circulam online:\nVersão 1: Paul MxCartney homenageando a Michele Bolsonaro! O molusco e a esbanja devem estar verdes de inveja! Versão 2: Agora, ou a Putanja se mata ou o Luladrão manda matar os “oponentes”…!!!!\nPaul, assim você deixa a junja no desespero. Quer fazer raiva pra Esbanja? pic.twitter.com/wecrdSxA8m — Tumulto BR (@TumultoBR) December 2, 2023\nChecagem\nNa parte da checagem do conteúdo, vamos responder às seguintes questões: 1) É verdade que Paul McCartney cantou uma música para Michelle Bolsonaro? 2) Em que contexto ele cantou a música Michelle e “pediu desculpas para o presidente”? 3) Paul McCartney tem simpatia por Bolsonaro?\nÉ verdade que Paul McCartney cantou uma música para Michelle Bolsonaro?\nNão é verdade. Para quem não sabe, a música Michelle foi lançada em 1965, no álbum Rubber Soul. Ou seja: é de antes do nascimento de Michelle Bolsonaro. Além disso, o vídeo que está circulando na internet não é de 2023 e não tem relação com Jair Bolsonaro e o Brasil.\nEm que contexto ele cantou a música Michelle e “pediu desculpas para o presidente”?\nNa realidade, o vídeo em questão é de 2010. O pedido de “desculpas para o presidente” é, na realidade, direcionado ao ex-presidente dos Estados Unidos Barack Obama. Na ocasião, ele participou de um show dentro da Casa Branca nos Estados Unidos. Assista:\nPaul McCartney tem simpatia por Bolsonaro?\nNa ocasião, Paul McCartney declarou apoio a Barack Obama. Se formos pensar que Bolsonaro é de uma corrente política contrária a dele, podemos inferir que ele não nutre simpatia pelo ex-presidente brasileiro. Isso pode ser mostrado em uma entrevista de 2019 na qual ele disse ver a ascensão de “políticos que causam medo”.\nConclusão\nFake news ❌\nÉ falso que Paul McCartney cantou uma música em homenagem a ex-primeira-dama Michelle Bolsonaro. O vídeo foi uma dedicatória a Michelle Obama e nada tem a ver com 2023 e o Brasil.\nPs: Esse artigo é uma sugestão de leitores do Boatos.org.

    "maintext":"Aus Zahlen des Netzwerkes zur Überwachung der Sterblichkeit in den EU-Staaten (Euromomo) geht angeblich hervor, dass die Sterblichkeit von Kindern dramatisch zugenommen habe, nachdem die EU-Arzneimittelbehörde (EMA) Covid-Impfstoffs zugelassen hatte. Diese Behauptung wird mit der Überschrift «Nach der Notfallzulassung des Covid-Impfstoffs für Kinder durch die EMA steigt die Zahl der Todesfälle bei Kindern in Europa weiter in die Tausende» verbreitet.\nBewertung\nDie Behauptung ist falsch. Sie beruht auf einer falschen Interpretation der Statistik, vor der die Autoren der Statistik ausdrücklich warnen.\nFakten\nEin in Luxemburg geteilter Facebook-Post verlinkt zu einem Beitrag der schweizerischen Webseite uncutnews.ch - und zwar mit den Worten: «Es wird nicht mehr lange dauern, bis sich auch Luxemburg mit diesem Thema beschäftigen muss.»\nIn dem Artikel wird behauptet, dass in den Jahren 2020 und 2021 jeweils weniger Kinder als erwartet gestorben seien. Nach der Zulassung des Covid-Impfstoffes durch die EMA vom Mai 2021 habe jedoch die Zahl der «überzähligen Sterbefälle» deutlich zugenommen. Bis Ende 2021 seien 685 Kinder mehr als erwartet gestorben. Auch 2022 seien 1385 Kinder mehr als erwartet gestorben. Und auch bis zur 45. Woche des Jahres 2023 habe sich dieser Trend mit 753 überzähligen Todesfällen von Kindern fortgesetzt.\nUnterschied zwischen Erwartung und Wirklichkeit\nDas EU-Netzwerk zur Überwachung der Sterblichkeit (Euromomo) definiert die Übersterblichkeit als Unterschied zwischen der tatsächlich registrierten Zahl von Todesfällen und der erwarteten Zahl von Todesfällen. Die erwartete Zahl von Todesfällen wird normalerweise aufgrund der registrierten Todesfälle in den fünf vorangegangenen Jahren geschätzt. Und zwar für jede Woche einzeln. Dieses Verfahren wird auf der Webseite des Netzwerks und auch in den wöchentlichen Berichten über die Sterblichkeit in der EU erläutert.\nWegen der erhöhten und unterschiedlichen Sterblichkeit während der COVID-Pandemie hat Euromomo jedoch die Daten der drei Pandemiejahre 2020 bis 2022 aus der Berechnung der erwarteten Sterblichkeit herausgenommen. Unter anderem deswegen, weil die normale Annahme, dass es im Frühjahr und Herbst üblicherweise keine erhöhte Sterblichkeit gibt, in den Pandemiejahren nicht stimmte. Einfacher gesagt: Die erwartete Sterblichkeit beruht auf Berechnungen, die nicht die aktuelle Entwicklung der vergangenen fünf Jahre widerspiegeln. Erst seit Frühling 2023 werden wieder aktuelle Sterbedaten für die Berechnung der erwarteten Sterblichkeit verwendet.\nIm Bericht über die 19. Kalenderwoche (vom 8. bis 14. Mai 2023) weist Euromomo darauf hin, dass diese Tatsache gerade bei der Altersgruppe der Kinder bis zu 14 Jahren «im Laufe der Zeit zu einer zunehmenden Verzerrung geführt» habe. Dies gelte insbesondere dann, wenn die Zahlen kumuliert - also Woche für Woche aufaddiert - würden.\nDie geschätzte «Basislinie», also die erwartete Sterblichkeit, sei in den Jahren vor der Pandemie bei den Kindern stetig zurückgegangen. Wegen der Abwesenheit von Daten für die Jahre 2020 bis 2022 habe man diese nach unten gerichtete Basislinie der «rückläufigen Ausgangssterblichkeit» aufgrund der älteren Daten einfach weiter verlängern müssen.\nDie Zahl der gemeldeten Todesfälle war beispielsweise in der ersten Woche 2020 genauso hoch wie in der 40. Woche des Jahres 2022. Wegen der sinkenden Basislinie bedeutet dies jedoch, dass es in der 40. Woche des Jahres 2022 trotz identischer Zahlen eine Übersterblichkeit von 29 Todesfällen gegeben habe. Bei wöchentlicher Addition werde diese Verzerrung immer größer.\nAnders gesagt: Auch wenn es jede Woche die gleiche Zahl von Todesfällen gäbe, würde bei einer ständig sinkenden «Basislinie» die Übersterblichkeit stetig anstiegen. Daher warnt Euromomo, die kumulierten Ergebnisse hinsichtlich der berechneten Übersterblichkeit könnten «zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt nicht als zuverlässig angesehen werden und müssen mit großer Vorsicht interpretiert werden».\nDas Netzwerk betont im Mai 2023, es stellte «während der laufenden COVID-19-Pandemie nicht mehr Todesfälle bei den 0- bis 14-Jährigen fest als in der Zeit vor der COVID-19-Pandemie, auch wenn die auf der Euromomo-Website gemeldeten kumulierten Ergebnisse dies vermuten lassen».\nDie Webseite «uncutnews.ch» geht hingegen mit keinem Wort auf die ständigen Warnungen von Euromomo vor einer falschen Interpretation der Zahlen ein. Stattdessen behauptet sie, es sei «offensichtlich», dass die Verabreichung des Impfstoffs «Tausende Kinder mehr als erwartet das Leben gekostet hat». Diversen Studien zufolge haben sich allerdings die Corona-Impfstoffe als sicher und wirksam erwiesen.\nDie Impfstoffe wurden im Mai 2021 erst für Jugendliche ab 12 Jahren, im Dezember 2021 dann auch für Kinder ab fünf Jahren zugelassen. Die Ständige Impfkommission (Stiko) empfiehlt eine Corona-Impfung für gesunde Menschen unter 18 Jahren inzwischen nicht mehr, da sich unter anderem wegen der Omikron-Variante das Risikoprofil des Virus geändert hat.\n(Stand 04.12.2023)",

(Source: X/Facebook/Screenshot/Modified by Logically Facts)\nFact-Check The Verdict Misleading The video dates back to 2018 and is unrelated to the current truce between Israel and Hamas. Claim ID 3a1fd1e2\nWhat\\'s the claim?\nOn the night of Saturday, November 25, as part of a four-day truce and prisoner-hostage exchange deal between Israel and Hamas, Hamas released a second group of hostages to Israel. CBS News reported that Hamas released 17 hostages, and Israel freed 39 Palestinian women and children from the jail.\nAmid this, a video of a woman weeping and running towards a man to hug him is going viral on social media, with claims it shows a Palestinian mother meeting her son who has just been released in the ceasefire agreement. One such post on X (archived here) with the video had the caption translated from Arabic: \"After twenty years of imprisonment, pain, separation, and torment, a Palestinian mother meets her son, who was released as part of a prisoner exchange deal yesterday. What pain are you talking about, world?\" The post has gained 167,400 views and is being shared widely across Facebook (archived here) with a similar claim. Other archived versions are here, here, and here.\nScreenshot of posts on social media (Source: X/Facebook/Screenshot/Modified by Logically Facts)\nHowever, the video is not recent; it\\'s from 2018.\nWhat are the facts?\nA reverse search of the keyframes of the video led us to a Facebook post published on February 12, 2018, containing the same video. The page is from a community group called \"Al Mujtamae Al liybiu.\" The post\\'s caption, translated from Arabic, reads, \"He was imprisoned at the age of 18 and released at the age of 38. His mother had been patient for all these years, but she could not be patient for these minutes. She ran to him and crossed everything. #Mother Hadi, come on, mother. Oh God, protect our mother, Lord of the worlds.\"\nA report published by Al-Jumhuriya Al-Youm, a local media outlet covering Arab news, on February 11, 2018, also carried the same video and stated that it shows a Palestinian man meeting his mother after spending 20 years in an Israeli occupation prison.\nScreenshot of the report published by Al-Jumhuriya Al-Youm. (Source: Al-Jumhuriya Al-Youm/Screenshot)\nWe found the same video posted on another Facebook group named \"Ae shayrat Al shureat\" on November 4, 2018. The caption stated, \"Watch a touching video... A Palestinian mother hugs her son who was arrested in the Israeli occupation prisons when he was 18 years old and left when he was 38 years old.\"\nThe verdict\nThe viral clip shows a man being released from an Israeli prison but dates back to 2018. It does not depict a current prisoner-hostage exchange between Israel and Hamas. Therefore, we have marked the claim as misleading.",

Meanwhile, images of heavy rainfall have surfaced from Chennai, where the cyclone has triggered flooding, disrupting daily life.\nWhat is the claim?\nAgainst this backdrop, a video has been circulating on social media, claiming to show the damage caused by cyclone Michaung. The 21-second clip depicts heavy wind and rainfall flooding a street and surrounding areas. Several users have shared the video on X (formerly Twitter), linking the video to Michaung. The caption of one such post reads, “After massive earthquake shook #Philippines, now warning of a cyclone is issued for southern states of India. Looks like nature's reckoning is onto something.” The post has garnered over 83,000 views and 173 likes. Archived versions of the viral post and similar others can be viewed here and here.\nScreenshots of the viral posts on X. (Source: X/Modified by Logically Facts)\nHowever, this is an old video of heavy rains caused by cyclone Mocha at the Bangladesh-Myanmar border in May.\nWhat did we find?\nThe first four seconds of the viral video show a flooded street, while the remaining 17 seconds capture heavy rainfall lashing a building with trees swaying against strong winds in the background. A reverse image search on the keyframes of the viral video revealed that the first part of the clip is from a video captured in May. X user ‘Andhra Pradesh Weatherman’ had posted a longer version of the first part of the viral video on May 14, stating that it shows cyclone Mocha making landfall. He wrote, “#cycloneMocha Fury over Myanmar now. As expected a week ago, this cyclone is making Landfall now.”\nNews outlet WION had also posted a longer version of the first four seconds of the viral video on its official Facebook account on May 14. The caption of the post stated, “WATCH | #cycloneMocha made landfall at the Bangladesh-Myanmar border on Sunday. It is destroying trees and pouring torrential rain.”\nComparison between the viral clip and the video posted by WION. (Source: X/Facebook/Modified by Logically Facts)\nOn further research, we found that news agency Reuters had published the viral video on YouTube as a short on May 15. The YouTube short captured both scenes from the viral video: the flooded street and the rain-lashed building. The YouTube description stated that cyclone Mocha pummeled Myanmar. Quoting Myanmar’s state-run media, Reuters stated that at least three people were killed, and more than 1,000 buildings were damaged.\nComparison between the viral video and the YouTube short published by Reuters. (Source: X/YouTube/Modified by Logically Facts)\nIt is clear that the viral video dates back to May and is not related to cyclone Michaung. The video actually shows cyclone Mocha making landfall at the Bangladesh-Myanmar border.\nAftermath of cyclone Mocha\nCyclone Mocha made landfall along the coastlines of Bangladesh and Myanmar on May 14 and destroyed hundreds of makeshift shelters. According to a BBC report dated May 19, at least 145 people were killed in the storm. The Rohingya minority was heavily affected, as 117 out of the 145 victims were from the community. The severe storm affected at least 800,000 people, making it the strongest cyclone of the century to hit the region. NASA stated that the cyclone was a Category 5 storm, with winds roaring as fast as 175 miles (280 kilometers) per hour.\nThe verdict\nThe viral video does not show floods and damage caused by cyclone Michaung. Instead, it was captured in May when cyclone Mocha made landfall along the coastlines of Bangladesh and Myanmar. Therefore, we have marked this claim as false.",

    "maintext":"Wenn Krebspatienten an die \"Germanische Neue Medizin\" glauben und sich infolgedessen nicht medizinisch behandeln lassen, zeigen Beispiele, dass sie in Lebensgefahr geraten oder sterben können.\nDer bekannteste Fall ist Olivia Pilhar. 1995 erkrankte das damals sechsjährige österreichische Mädchen an Krebs. Ihre Eltern waren Anhänger Hamers, sie flohen mit ihrer Tochter aus Österreich, um sie vor medizinischer Behandlung zu \"schützen\". Am Ende wurde ihnen von den österreichischen Behörden das Sorgerecht entzogen und Olivia Pilhar ein inzwischen Fußball-großer Tumor entfernt.\nWarum Hamers Ideen medizinisch falsch sind\nKrebs entsteht, wenn sich Zellen im Körper unkontrolliert vermehren. \"Grund sind meist Schäden am Erbgut dieser Zellen oder Fehler beim Ablesen der Erbinformation\", schreibt der Krebsinformationsdienst des Deutschen Krebsforschungszentrums.\nEin Tumor entsteht, wenn Zellen sich anders als vorgesehen verhalten: Wenn sie wachsen und sich teilen, wenn sie eigentlich nicht sollten. Wenn sie nicht absterben, obwohl sie sollten. Oder wenn sie ihren vorgesehenen Platz im Körper verlassen. Der Tumor zerstört das angrenzende Gewebe und kann sich in andere Teile des Körpers ausbreiten.\nEs gibt äußere Einflüsse, die Krebs begünstigen können. Dazu gehören der Lebensstil (Übergewicht, Rauchen), Umweltfaktoren (krebserregende Stoffe wie Asbest) und Krankheitserreger (HP-Viren erhöhen das Risiko für Gebärmutterhalskrebs). Ein weiterer Einfluss sind die Gene eines Menschen. \"Manche Menschen haben ein erhöhtes Krebsrisiko, weil sich in allen Zellen ihres Körpers Veränderungen am Erbgut finden, die die Krebsentstehung fördern\", schreibt der Krebsinformationsdienst.\nEin anderer wichtiger Faktor ist schlicht Zufall. Denn bei einer Zellteilung können Fehler einfach so entstehen, selbst wenn die Person keine anderen Risikofaktoren aufweist. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit für Krebs steigt mit dem Alter stark, schreibt die Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO, höchstwahrscheinlich weil sich verschiedene Risiken akkumulieren und Reparaturmechanismen in den Zellen weniger wirksam sind.\nPsychische Belastungen und Krebs: Was dazu bekannt ist\nEs gebe keinen Beweis für einen kausalen Zusammenhang zwischen psychischer Belastung und der Entstehung von Krebs, sagt Anja Mehnert-Theuerkauf im Gespräch mit dem #Faktenfuchs. Mehnert-Theuerkauf ist Professorin für Medizinische Psychologie und Medizinische Soziologie am Universitätsklinikum Leipzig. \"Die Studienlage ist, glaube ich, wirklich doch sehr, sehr robust, was diesen Faktor anbetrifft.\"\n\"Es gibt bisher nichts bis sehr wenig, was dafür spricht, dass Krebs durch Stress, durch ein Trauma, durch Depressionen oder auch durch eine bestimmte Persönlichkeitsstruktur ausgelöst wird\", sagt auch Birgit Hiller dem #Faktenfuchs.\nEs gibt einige Studien, die der Frage nach einem möglichen Zusammenhang nachgehen. Bei knapp 90.000 dänischen Patienten wurde kein Beleg dafür gefunden, dass eine Depression alleine das Krebsrisiko erhöht. Bei 14.000 französischen Patienten wurde ebenfalls kein Beweis für einen Zusammenhang zwischen depressiven Symptomen und Krebs entdeckt.\nIn einer britischen Studie wurden die Brustkrebsfälle bei 106.000 Frauen erhoben. Die Krebsfälle wurden mit einem erhöhten Stresslevel und belastenden Lebensereignissen wie Todesfälle im nahen Umfeld, Scheidung, schwere Krankheit oder Jobverlust abgeglichen. Das Ergebnis: Es gab keine belastbaren Hinweise auf einen Zusammenhang zwischen Krebs und den Ereignissen.\nEine Meta-Studie aus 2023 fasste die Daten von 18 verschiedenen Patientengruppen mit insgesamt knapp 320.000 Personen zusammen, bei denen Symptome von Depression oder Angststörung auftraten oder diese Krankheiten diagnostiziert wurden. Außerdem war in den Daten enthalten, ob die Personen an Krebs erkrankten. Die Wissenschaftler folgerten, dass eine Depression oder eine Angststörung nicht mit einem erhöhten Krebsrisiko einherging, mit einer Ausnahme: Krebsarten, die mit Rauchen zusammenhingen. Zu dieser möglichen Verknüpfung zwischen psychischer Belastung und Lebensstil später mehr.\nEs gibt auch Studien mit vielen Probanden, die eine Korrelation zwischen psychischer Belastung und erhöhtem Krebsrisiko beschrieben, zum Beispiel bei Depressionen und Angststörungen, Arbeitsstress oder nur Depressionen.\nKorrelation bedeutet aber nicht Kausalität, es kann sich ebenso um einen zufälligen oder indirekten Zusammenhang handeln. Bei diesen Studien wurde bei den untersuchten Personen mit psychischen Belastungen ein erhöhtes (Todes-)Risiko für bestimmte Krebsarten gefunden. Allerdings ist dies noch kein Beweis, dass psychische Belastung Vorgänge im Körper auslöst, die Krebs begünstigen. Die vom #Faktenfuchs befragten Expertinnen verweisen auf eine andere mögliche Erklärung.\nIndirekter Einfluss durch Verhaltensänderung ist möglich\nEs gebe für manche Menschen eventuell einen indirekten Zusammenhang zwischen psychischen Belastungen und Krebs, sagt die medizinische Psychologin Mehnert-Theuerkauf: Wenn die Personen ihr Verhalten ändern. \"Wenn jemand depressiv ist, raucht er vielleicht mehr, trinkt er vielleicht auch mehr, hat weniger Sozialkontakte, die das Stressniveau regulieren können. Er isst vielleicht auch ungesünder und bewegt sich weniger\", sagt sie.\nAuch Birgit Hiller vom Krebsinformationsdienst sagt, dass es einen \"unbestrittenen\" indirekten Zusammenhang gebe: \"Wenn man durch Stress, durch Depressionen oder während einer langen, belastenden Lebensphase einfach nicht gesund lebt. Wer Stress mit Zigaretten und Alkohol bekämpft, hat ein höheres Krebsrisiko.\"\nPsychische Belastungen oder erschütternde Lebensereignisse könnten noch auf anderem Wege eine Rolle spielen, sagt Hiller: Nämlich falls jemand sich aufgrund dessen nicht aufraffen könne, zur Früherkennung oder anderen Untersuchungen zu gehen. Dann könne das dazu führen, dass Krebs gar nicht oder erst zu spät erkannt oder ungenügend behandelt werde, sagt Hiller. Wer den Tod seines Kindes betrauere, habe vielleicht anderes im Kopf, als ein Muttermal auf Hautkrebs-Gefahr hin abklären zu lassen.\nTrotz der Sachlage: Der Glaube, dass seelische und psychische Probleme Krebs bedingen, ist in Deutschland weit verbreitet. In einer repräsentativen Umfrage des Krebsinformationsdienstes aus 2017 wurden gut 2.000 Personen befragt. 61 Prozent davon stimmten der Aussage zu \"Seelische Probleme und Stress verursachen Krebs\", obwohl es keinen erwiesenen direkten Zusammenhang gibt.\nOrganisation der GNM: Keine Gruppe, eher Szene\nDie Anhänger der GNM verbreiten ihre Ideen heutzutage im Internet und kommen in Facebook-Gruppen oder Kanälen auf dem Messenger-Dienst Telegram ins Gespräch. Diese Gruppen und Kanäle haben meist mehrere Tausend, teils mehr als 10.000 Mitglieder. Gleichzeitig veranstalten die Anhänger der GNM aber auch persönliche Treffen oder öffentliche Vorträge. In Deutschland gibt es mehrere \"Studienkreise\", bei denen die GNM vorgestellt und besprochen wird.\nMatthias Pöhlmann ist Weltanschauungsbeauftragter der evangelisch-lutherischen Kirche in Bayern. Er sieht keine gruppenähnlichen Strukturen mit Hierarchie oder einem klaren Ziel. Er beschäftigt sich mit Bewegungen wie der GNM, zu der er auch schon geforscht hat.\n\"Ich kann da noch keinen ganz starken Zusammenschluss oder einen Organisationsgrad entdecken\", sagt er. Die GNM könne sich aber leicht weiterverbreiten bei bestimmten Personengruppen und dort Anschluss finden: Bei Heilpraktikern, bei rechten Esoterikern bis hin zu Gruppierungen wie der Anastasia-Bewegung, die vom Verfassungsschutz in Brandenburg als rechtsextremer Verdachtsfall eingestuft wird. Bei rechtsextremen Gruppen werde die GNM als \"ursprüngliche\" Medizin dargestellt, sagt Pöhlmann.\nDie GNM-Szene wirbt auch in anderen Bereichen, in der \"Mitte der Gesellschaft\", wie Pöhlmann sagt. Er berichtet von einem Fall an einer Münchner Musikschule, wo eine Heilpraktikerin einen Vortrag zu den Thesen Hamers gehalten habe.\nKlassifikation der GNM: Alternativmedizin, Esoterik oder Verschwörungserzählung?\nDie Methoden der \"Germanischen Neue Medizin\" sind grundsätzlich nichts komplett Neues. Alternative Angebote jenseits der Medizin, die Wahrheit und Heilung versprechen, habe es schon immer gegeben, sagt Matthias Pöhlmann, der Weltanschauungsbeauftragte der evangelisch-lutherischen Kirche in Bayern.\n\"Das hat die evidenzbasierte Medizin schon immer begleitet, dass es neben esoterischen Heilungs-Offerten auch naturheilkundliche, volkskundliche Methoden und Bereiche gegeben hat. Denken wir nur auch an die Homöopathie\", sagt Pöhlmann. Die Klassifizierung der \"Germanischen Neuen Medizin\" sei trotzdem nicht ganz einfach. \"Sie ist unheimlich anschlussfähig an rechts-esoterisches, verschwörungsideologisches Gedankengut\", sagt Pöhlmann.\nRyke Geerd Hamer mischte im Lauf der Jahre antisemitische Verschwörungserzählungen in das Weltbild seiner Pseudo-Medizin. Er behauptete, Juden würden die GNM nur für sich einsetzen und anderen vorenthalten.\nDie Chemotherapie gegen Krebs sei eine Erfindung der Juden, mit der sie einen Genozid an Nicht-Juden verüben würden, behauptete Hamer. Das Motiv einer weltweiten geheimen Verschwörung von Juden, um andere Menschen zu schädigen, ist ein jahrhundertealter antisemitischer Verschwörungsmythos. Eine Chemotherapie - die Entwicklung geht auf den Mediziner Paul Ehrlich zurück - ist eine \"der zentralen Säulen der Krebstherapie\", schreibt die Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft. Damit sollen Tumore am Wachsen gehindert werden.\nHamer war Holocaust-Leugner und Anhänger von Reichsbürger-Thesen. Er hielt das Grundgesetz der Bundesrepublik Deutschland für illegitim, Ausgangspunkt für eine neue Verfassung solle ein antidemokratisches, rechtsextremes, verschwörungsideologisches Narrativ sein, schreibt Matthias Pöhlmann in seinem Buch \"Rechte Esoterik\". 2006 äußerte Hamer, dass er bereit wäre, für das Amt des Reichspräsidenten eines zukünftigen Deutschen Reichs zu kandidieren.\nDie Suche nach dem \"Warum?\" - deswegen glauben Menschen an die GNM\n\"Wir erleben eine enorme Pluralisierung der Angebote, eine hochkomplexe Welt. Vielen macht auch diese Komplexität zu schaffen\", sagt Theologe Matthias Pöhlmann. Manche Menschen verstünden die moderne Medizin nicht. \"Und diese große Unübersichtlichkeit verleitet viele Menschen dazu, wirklich nach einfachen Lösungen Ausschau zu halten\", sagt Pöhlmann.\nDie GNM-Befürworter eine der pseudo-medizinische Aspekt, meint Pöhlmann. Es seien Menschen mit Vorbehalten gegenüber der evidenzbasierten Medizin. Kranke Menschen, die nach dem letzten Strohhalm greifen. Menschen mit Angst vor Krebserkrankungen.\nWie mit Angehörigen/Betroffenen sprechen?\n\"Die Suche nach einer Ursache, nach einem Auslöser, ist eigentlich ganz normal\", sagt Birgit Hiller vom Krebsinformationsdienst. Hiller hat deswegen einen Rat für Angehörige und Bekannte von Krebspatienten. Der gut gemeinte Spruch \"Du musst positiv denken\" sei nicht hilfreich. Das suggeriere, dass der oder die Kranke bisher \"falsch gelebt, falsch gefühlt, falsch gedacht\" habe. Wenn eine Erkrankung womöglich fortschreite oder bei einem Rückfall würde dem Betreffenden impliziert: Du hast dich nicht richtig angestrengt.\nWenn eine Person schon an die GNM glaube, dann gebe es kein \"Patentrezept\" für sein Umfeld, sagt Matthias Pöhlmann. \"Aber das Wichtigste ist zunächst mal versuchen, unbedingt Kontakt zu halten, im Gespräch zu bleiben, vielleicht auch versuchen, kritische Informationen zur GNM zu vermitteln.\" Falls noch Gespräche möglich seien, könne man auf die problematischen Elemente der GNM hinweisen und die dadurch verursachten Todesfälle. Angehörige und Betroffene eines GNM-Gläubigen sollten sich Beratung und Hilfe bei Beratungsstellen wie staatlichen Einrichtungen oder den Kirchen holen, rät Pöhlmann.\nFazit\nFür die pseudo-medizinischen Ansichten der \"Germanischen Neue Medizin\" (GNM) gibt es keine wissenschaftliche Grundlage. Die \"Behandlungsempfehlungen\" für Krebs lauten, auf eine medizinische Therapie zu verzichten, emotionale Konflikte aufzulösen und Musik zu hören. Das kann lebensgefährliche Folgen haben.\nKern-Behauptung der GNM ist, dass emotional belastende Erlebnisse Auslöser für Krebs und alle anderen Krankheiten seien. Viele Menschen in Deutschland nehmen an, dass psychische Belastungen Krebs auslösen können. Es gibt aber keine Hinweise auf einen direkten Zusammenhang, sagen Wissenschaftlerinnen und Mediziner. Was unbestritten ist: Falls es infolge von psychischen Belastungen zu ungesunden Verhaltensänderungen, wie erhöhtem Rauchen oder Alkoholkonsum, kommt, kann dies das Krebsrisiko erhöhen.\nHinweis: Der Krebsinformationsdienst des Deutschen Krebsforschungszentrums beantwortet Betroffenen und Angehörigen kostenlos Fragen per Telefon oder Mail. Sollten Sie Hilfe brauchen, weil Personen aus Ihrem Umfeld sich problematischen oder Sekten-ähnlichen Gruppen anschließen, dann gibt es dafür staatliche und kirchliche Beratungsstellen. Auch Aussteiger können sich dort melden.",

Further, we looked for news reports on the person named Fatima, who used Visiorax to restore her vision. This search, too, did not yield any credible evidence supporting the claim.\nWe learned that according to the National Eye Institute of the US, which performs vision research and education, the treatments for refractive errors like myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia are either glasses, contact lenses, or surgery.\nThey have not listed Visiorax or, for that matter, any capsule as the solution for the refractive errors.\nVisiorax is also not listed as an approved drug by either the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Indian Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO).\nWhen someone on Practo asked if Visiorax is an effective medicine to restore eyesight, Dr Saba Kausar, a verified ophthalmologist on Practo, said that Medicine cannot reduce refractive errors.\nSpanish fact-checking website “Verifica rtve” labelled Vsiorax as a complete hoax.\nFurther searches revealed that in December 2021, the FDA approved the usage of eye drops named Vuity for the treatment of age-related blurry vision, known as presbyopia.\nHealthline reported that this improves new vision for 2-3 hours.

Speaking to the ANI, then Baghpat SHO Sanjeev Kumar informed the accused name as Kapil Chauhan and said he was taken into custody on 09 December 2018.\nUpon searching for further details, we found a tweet published by the Baghpat police related to this incident on 10 December 2018. The Baghpat police through the tweet informed that the accused was taken into custody by the Baraut police. The First Information Report (FIR) pertaining to this incident explicitly mentioned the name of the accused as Kapil. From all these pieces of evidence, it can be concluded that the video shows an old incident in which there is no communal angle.\nTo sum it up, a 2018 video of female students thrashing an eve-teaser in Uttar Pradesh is shared now with a false communal narrative.",

Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\nOn performing a reverse image search of the keyframes extracted from the video we found that the same video is uploaded by a YouTube channel Andri Sundaisme. Upon examination of the close-up version of the viral video on the channel with the same claim, it became clear that the baby wasn’t singing at all. Instead, she was observed holding the microphone and sitting while placing it inside her mouth. Moreover, the video description indicates it’s a parody, and we have observed that the channel consistently posts similar parody content. Additionally, a few videos include a disclaimer emphasizing that it’s for entertainment purposes. We also found that the baby in the viral video appeared in numerous videos with different outfits.\nOn further research of the keyframes, we found that the segment showing the reactions of actress Neetu Singh, and singers Himesh Reshammiya and Neha Kakkar is from an episode (here and here) of the Indian idol show where judges got emotional by watching a tribute video to Late Rishi Kapoor played on the show.\nWe found that the segment of Bollywood actor Salman Khan is from a show named Das ka Dum hosted by him in 2018 (here and here).\nTo sum up, this video shared as a baby reciting Quran on an Indian idol show is a parody.",

    "maintext":"A viral video on social media claims that Australian cricketer David Warner removed Coca-Cola bottles from a table during a press conference like how soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo did a few years ago. It is being claimed that Coca-Cola is an Israeli brand. The Palestinian flag in the post implies David Warner’s actions are related to his support of Palestine in the context of the ongoing Palestine-Israel conflict. Let’s fact-check this claim through this article.\nClaim: David Warner removed Israeli Coca-Cola bottles from a table during a press conference in support of Palestine. Fact: This is an old video from 2021 which happened in a press conference held during the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2021. In the original video, David Warner kept the Coca-Cola bottles back and said nothing about Palestinen when he did this. Hence, the claim made in the post is False.\nTo learn more about the viral video, we conducted a basic keyword search online. This search led us to the full video clip from 2021 showing David Warner removing the Coca-Cola bottles from a table during a press conference. We also found a few news reports (here, here, and here) on this along with the video.\nReportedly, in a press conference held during the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2021, David Warner removed two Coca-Cola bottles displayed on the press conference table in front of him and said “Can I remove this?” “However, he was asked to put them back. To this, Warner said, “If it is good for Cristiano, it’s good enough for me.” Wion reported.\nThis makes it clear that the viral post spins a false narrative around this incident of him removing Coca-Cola bottles from the press conference table as something he has done in support of Palestine. In reality, he did not even mention anything about Palestine when removing the bottles.\nAdditionally, through a quick Google search, we found that Coca-Cola is not an Israeli brand. Coca-Cola was produced first by John Stith Pemberton who was a pharmacist in Atlanta, Georgia which is in the United States, not Israel.\nTo sum up, the viral claim that Australian Cricketer David Warner removed Coca-Cola bottles during a press conference in support of Palestine is False.",

    "maintext":"A speech of Netherlands’ Party for Freedom or Freedom Party (PVV) leader Geert Wilders is being shared on social media with a claim that it his is first speech after he was elected as the Prime Minister of Netherlands. It is being claimed that he was warning Muslims when he said “If you want sharia law and don’t respect our law and freedom of expression go to any Islamic country.” Let’s fact-check this claim through this article.\nClaim: Netherlands’ newly elected PM Geert Wilders warned Muslims in his first public speech. Fact: This is an old video from November 2020. Geert Wilders’ political party Party for Freedom or Freedom Party (PVV) won in the Netherlands General Election 2023, but he was not elected as the Prime Minister since his party won only 24% of seats in the 150-seat Dutch parliament and it needs support from other parties to form a government. Hence, the claim made in the post is False.\nFirstly, a keyword search on the internet revealed (here, here, and here) that Geert Wilders had not been elected as the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. Although his party PVV won the General election, they have to get support from other parties to form a government as they won only 24% of seats in the Netherlands Parliament. His party PVV won 37 seats of the total 150 seats in the parliament.\nTo learn more details about the viral video, we performed a reverse image search on a few of its keyframes which led us to the original version of the viral video which is actually Geert Wilders’ speech given in the Dutch parliament. This video available on a verified YouTube channel named PVVpers was uploaded on 12 November 2020 with a title in Duch that translates to “Input from Geert Wilder’s terror debate (12-11-2020)”\nThe viral video has been clipped from this 16:44 seconds clip and the viral portion can be seen from 2:50. From the translation of the Auto-Generated subtitles on YouTube, we understood that Geert Wilder was speaking about the murder of the French teacher Samuel Paty, which happened in October 2020. Later in the speech, he goes on to speak about Muslims and Islam and makes a few proposals that are also seen in the viral video.\nA further search also revealed that a translation for this speech was uploaded in November 2020 by an Investigative Journalist named Amy Mek on X, which seems like the video that has gone viral now.\nAlthough, Factly could not independently verify the authenticity of the translation for his speech in this video (we relied on the translate feature on YouTube to understand the context of his speech), since the video predates the current election and contradicts the claim that this video shows Wilders’ first public speech after the election, it is safe to say that the viral claim is False.\nTo sum up, Geert Wilders has not been elected as the Prime Minister of the Netherlands yet. This video claiming to be his first speech after the 22 November 2023 election is actually from November 2020..",

Para além das mesmas postagens em redes sociais anunciando para a venda do livro e do documentário, nada há em fontes confiáveis sobre o lançamento dos tais livro e documentário criados em parceria entre os ex-presidente dos EUA e do Brasil. Para além disso, o vídeo não tem nada a ver com o produto.\nQual é o contexto do vídeo de Trump e Bolsonaro que está sendo utilizado como o anúncio?\nA legenda colocada no vídeo está errada. Na realidade, Trump faz um anúncio da presença de Bolsonaro em um evento. Ele, de fato, diz que Bolsonaro é um político muito popular na América do Sul e no Brasil. Porém, não fala nada em lançamento de documentário ou mesmo sobre eles falarem que “vão voltar”.\nAo buscar pelo vídeo, descobrimos que ele é da edição do CPAC (um evento nos Estados Unidos de líderes conservadores) de 2023. Na ocasião, Trump destacou (conforme aponta este vídeo publicado no site Poder 360) que o ex-presidente do Brasil é muito popular. Assista:\n\ufeff\nO que acontece se você comprar o livro e o documentário atribuídos a Bolsonaro e Trump?\nAssim como neste outro caso, de um livro que estava sendo vendido como se fosse de Bolsonaro, você será enganado. No caso do livro que já desmentimos a autoria, tratava-se de um compilado de conteúdos sobre Bolsonaro criados com ferramentas de inteligência artificial.\nSe você tentar comprar o livro de Donald Trump e Bolsonaro (o mesmo vale para o documentário), vai ter acesso a uma obra que não tem a autoria deles e, com certeza, com qualidade sofrível (apesar que um livro escrito por ambos talvez não fosse tão melhor).\nConclusão\nFake news ❌\nNão é verdade que Donald Trump anunciou o lançamento de um livro e um documentário em conjunto com o ex-presidente do Brasil Jair Bolsonaro. O vídeo está legendado de forma errada e a intenção de quem o fez é vender um conteúdo falsamente atribuído a eles.\nPs: Esse artigo é uma sugestão de leitores do Boatos.org.

    "maintext":"Boato – As pessoas que recebem ajudar social na Dinamarca estão impedidas de votar.\nAnálise\nDurante as eleições da Argentina, uma teoria antiga (que também viralizou na internet) voltou a circular na internet. De acordo com o texto (que circulou em espanhol e português), a Dinamarca resolveu tomar uma atitude drástica.\nA mensagem aponta que as pessoas que recebem ajuda social no país passaram a serem impedidas de votar. O objetivo seria evitar o “assistencialismo” e, claro, virou “sugestão” da direita para países sul-americanos. Leia:\nVersão 1: Na Dinamarca toda pessoa que recebe algum tipo de ajuda social fica inabilitada para votar. Desta forma se evita que a cidadania se transforme em clientelismo político e que sejam votantes cativos. 🤔🤔🤔🤔\nVersão 2 (espanhol):En Dinamarca toda persona que recibe algún tipo de ayuda social esta inhabilitada para votar. De esta forma se evita que la ciudadanía se transforme en clientelismo político y que sean votantes cautivos. Compartí esto si queres que en la Argentina suceda lo mismo.\nChecagem\nNa parte da checagem do conteúdo, vamos responder às seguintes questões: 1) É verdade que a Dinamarca está impedindo pessoas que recebem ajuda social de votar? 2) Quais são as regras sobre ajudas sociais e votação na Dinamarca? 3) Seria uma boa ideia Brasil e Argentina imitarem a “iniciativa” (que não ocorreu)?\nÉ verdade que a Dinamarca está impedindo pessoas que recebem ajuda social de votar?\nNão é verdade. A fake news não é nova. De acordo com este artigo de checagem da RTVE (da Espanha), a história falsa circula na internet, no mínimo, desde 2019. Em 2022, a própria embaixada da Dinamarca na Argentina desmentiu a história em seu perfil oficial no Facebook. Há alguns trechos que são interessantes de se destacar que vamos responder nas próximas questões.\nQuais são as regras sobre ajuda social e votação na Dinamarca?\nA própria embaixada apontou que há regras específicas sobre ajuda social e votação e essas não se correlacionam e que, sim, há um mal-entendido. Leia o artigo:\nNa Dinamarca, você NÃO perde o direito de voto ao receber assistência social! Devido às consultas que recebemos, gostaríamos de esclarecer que é incorreto afirmar que na Dinamarca se está incapacitado para votar quando se recebe ajuda social.\nDe acordo com a Constituição da Dinamarca, qualquer pessoa com nacionalidade dinamarquesa, residência permanente no país e que tenha atingido a maioridade para votar (hoje, aos 18 anos) pode votar, a menos que esteja sob tutela (ou seja, declarada incapaz de lidar com suas circunstâncias financeiras ou pessoais). Pessoas sob tutela são poucas, menos de 1.900 de um total de mais de 4 milhões de eleitores.\nO mal-entendido provavelmente vem da seguinte frase da Constituição: “É determinado por lei, até que ponto a punição e o apoio que a lei considera ‘ajuda aos pobres’ implica a perda dos direitos de voto”. Ou seja, deve ser determinado por outra lei que não a Constituição.\nA explicação seguinte: Antes de 1933, a assistência social era dada como “Ajuda aos pobres”, o que significava que não se podia votar. Com a Reforma Social de 1933, foram introduzidos vários outros benefícios sociais, que em grande parte substituíram a “Ajuda aos pobres”. Isso significou que muitos dos que anteriormente recebiam “Ajuda aos pobres” obtiveram outros benefícios que não implicaram a perda dos direitos de voto. Finalmente, a “Ajuda aos pobres” foi oficialmente eliminada da lei dinamarquesa em 1961. Isso significa que todos os qualificados podem votar hoje, a menos que estejam sob tutela.\nSe você encontrar alguém que diga que você não pode votar na Dinamarca se receber ajuda social, agora você pode dar a essa pessoa essa explicação. Fatos: – Em uma das últimas eleições parlamentares na Dinamarca, 4.145.105 pessoas tinham o direito de votar. 85,89% dessas pessoas votaram. – Em 2019, cerca de 1.900 pessoas na Dinamarca estavam sob tutela, o que corresponde a menos de 0,05% daqueles que têm direito a votar. – Em comparação, em 2018, houve 702.600 beneficiários de assistência social entre 16 e 64 anos que tinham permissão para exercer seu direito democrático de votar nas eleições parlamentares.\nSeria uma boa ideia Brasil e Argentina imitarem a “iniciativa” (que não ocorreu)?\nNão. Na realidade, o voto universal é um direito e um dever de todas as pessoas. Criar mecanismos que evitem que pessoas deixem de votar por conta de questões econômicas retira a universalidade do voto e causa problemas à democracia.\nÉ no voto que a escolha do rico vale a mesma coisa que a escolha do pobre. Obviamente, é possível criar mecanismo para se evitar fraudes ou mesmo uso da máquina pública (uma delas está na própria conscientização da população e fiscalização). Proibir pobres de votar não é um destes mecanismo.\nConclusão\nFake news ❌\nÉ falso que a Dinamarca proibiu as pessoas que recebem ajuda social de votarem. Trata-se de uma fake news que já circula há anos na internet e foi importada pelo Brasil durante as eleições argentinas de 2023.\nPs: Esse artigo é uma sugestão de leitores do Boatos.org.

    "maintext":"Boato – Empresas como a Tim, Oi, Claro e Vivo estão vendendo celulares de vitrine com 80% de desconto em site anunciado em redes sociais.\nAnálise\nEm mais uma tentativa de enganar “inocentes”, um anúncio está circulando em redes sociais com algumas variáveis. Via de regra, ele aponta para uma suposta oportunidade dada por operadoras de telefonia.\nO texto linkado no anúncio é de um site similar ao portal g1 (portal de notícias da Globo) e aponta que operadoras (vimos exemplos com a Tim, mas temos indícios de buscas por conteúdos similares relacionados à Oi, Claro e Vivo) estariam vendendo os celulares colocados nas vitrines das lojas com 80% de desconto.\nAo final, o site leva o internauta a um suposto site de vendas que seria do tal celular com superdesconto. Leia uma das mensagens que circula online (que fala sobre a suposta oferta sendo atribuída à Tim). Leia:\nA Tim vende os Smartphones usados nas “vitrines” pelo preço de custo e quase ninguém sabe disso. Smartphones com até 80% de desconto. Saiba como e onde comprar. A Tim separa alguns celulares de seu estoque para ficar nas lojas expostos.\nEsses itens são manuseados diariamente e expostos ao público, então não podem ser vendidos como novos. Quando as lojas têm que mudar suas vitrines, elas vendem esses celulares “seminovos” pelo preço de custo, com até 80% de desconto. Exclusivamente esse mês o estoque de celulares com desconto cresceu.\nChecagem\nPara fazer a checagem, vamos responder a algumas questões: 1) A Tim, Oi, Vivo e Claro estão fazendo uma oferta de celulares anunciados na vitrine das lojas com 80% de desconto? 2) O g1 noticiou isso? 3) As empresas fazem algum tipo de oferta com celulares anunciados nas vitrines das lojas?\nA Tim, Oi, Vivo e Claro estão fazendo uma oferta de celulares anunciados na vitrine das lojas com 80% de desconto?\nNão. Assim como em tantos outros casos que já desmentimos na internet, trata-se de uma informação falsa que está sendo promovida por meio de anúncios publicados em redes sociais. Não há qualquer página das operadoras que aponte para a tal oferta.\nMais do que isso: trata-se de um golpe. Se você tentar fazer a compra dos tais “celulares de vitrine” por meio do site anunciado na publicação (o site sempre muda, mas nunca é o oficial da operadora), muito provavelmente vai fazer o pagamento, mas não vai receber o produto (o que não falta na internet é reclamação sobre sites que anunciam os tais celulares de vitrine).\nO g1 noticiou isso?\nNão. Na realidade, a tentativa de emular um portal de notícia conhecido é mais uma tática utilizada pelos golpistas. Não há nada no portal de notícias da Globo sobre a tal ação das operadoras. O motivo é apenas um: elas não fazem este tipo de ação.\nAs empresas fazem algum tipo de oferta com celulares anunciados nas vitrines das lojas?\nNão há qualquer ação oficial das operadoras (ou pelo menos não encontramos) sobre a venda de celulares que ficam expostos nas vitrines. É possível (conforme mostra esta matéria) que algumas lojas de celulares (assim como outras lojas) vendam itens de mostruário. Porém, não há uma ação em massa disso ou mesmo garantia de 80% de desconto.\nConclusão\nGolpe ⚠️\nÉ falso que operadoras como a Tim, Oi, Claro e Vivo estejam fazendo a venda de celulares que estavam expostos em vitrines. Os anúncios que estão circulando em redes sociais não passam de mais uma tentativa de golpe que está na praça.\nPs: Esse artigo é uma sugestão de leitores do Boatos.org.

The viral video is from this(ASAS) Islamic Institution run by Malik Deenar Islamic Complex (MIC).\nThe ASAS took the decision, and added a structured syllabus to teach the ancient and classical language, to inculcate in the students, knowledge and awareness about other religions, the institute said.\nASAS sets an example of an Islamic educational institution that aims to provide a diverse education to their students by teaching Sanskrit and Hindu texts to make their students understand Hindu and other religions. ASAS also has a Sanskrit speech competition where all the Sanskrit learning students participate.\nThe same event was covered by many media outlets such as NDTV, TOI, Outlook India, TNIE, Telegraph India, The Print, The Economic Times and many others.\nIn the whole event covered by media information nowhere it is reported that a Muslim teacher teaching Sanskrit, Upanisads, and shlokas to Muslim students to gain a priest position, but was shared in such a false narrative to mislead the people.\nConclusion\nThe 11-month-old video of a Muslim teacher teaching Sanskrit to Muslim students is falsely shared as an activity to gain them a priest position. This claim is misleading because Sanskrit is being educated in the Muslim institution to learn and understand other languages and religions.",

(یک منبع اسراییلی او را نوجوان ۱۷ ساله معرفی کرده است.) شبکه جهانی بی\u200cبی\u200cسی روز گذشته گفت\u200cوگویی با محمد نزال و چند زندانی دیگر منتشر کرد. بر اساس این گزارش به نقل از محمد آمده که او از مرداد ماه در زندان نفحه (Nafha) در بازداشت به سر می\u200cبرد. بعضی از گزارش\u200cها حاکی از آن است که او محکوم به شش ماه حبس بوده و از سه ماه پیش در زندان به سر می\u200cبرد. در گزارش بی\u200cبی\u200cسی اما تاکید شده که «بدون هیچ اتهامی» بازداشت بوده. در گزارش بی\u200cبی\u200cسی آمده که این زندانیان فلسطینی که از پیش از حمله ۷ اکتبر حماس در اسرائیل زندانی بودند می\u200cگویند که بعد از وقوع این حمله، در زندان مجازات دسته\u200cجمعی شدند، کتک خوردند، تحقیر شدند و تهدید به تجاوز شدند. آنها می\u200cگویند که طی هفت هفته گذشته، شش زندانی فلسطینی در زندان اسرائیل کشته شدند. محمد نزال در گفت\u200cوگو با بی\u200cبی\u200cسی می\u200cگوید ده روز پیش (یک هفته پیش از آزادی) زندانبانان به بند آمدند، اول جوانان و بعد مسن\u200cترها را کتک زدند. خبرنگار بی\u200cبی\u200cسی به نقل از محمد می\u200cگوید رفتار نگهبانان داخل زندان\u200cهای اسرائیل پس از حملات حماس در۷ اکتبر تغییر کرد. نگهبانان آنها را با لگد و چوب می\u200cزدند و یکی از نگهبانان پاهایش را روی صورت او گذاشت. به گفته این زندانی نگهبانان سگ\u200cهایی را به بند آوردند تا به زندانیان حمله کنند و سگی به او حمله کرده که آثار دندان\u200cها و پنجه\u200cهایش بر بدن او به جا مانده. تشک\u200cها، لباس\u200cها و بالش\u200cهای آنها را بردند و غذای زندانیان را روی زمین می\u200cریختند. خبرنگار بی\u200cبی\u200cسی می\u200cگوید آثاری را بر روی پشت و شانه محمد مشاهده کرده که او گفته بود حاصل این شکنجه\u200cها بوده است. محمد می\u200cگوید که دست\u200cهایش در ابتدا درد زیادی داشت و بعد از مدتی متوجه شد که آنها شکسته\u200cاند. در زمان خوردن و نوشیدن و حمام کردن، زندانیان دیگر به او کمک می\u200cکردند و او از ترس اینکه دوباره کتک بخورد از نگهبانان کمک پزشکی نخواسته است. او گفته که اولین خدمات پزشکی را در اتوبوس صلیب سرخ بعد از خروج از زندان دریافت کرده است. بنابراین به نظر می\u200cرسد اولین مصاحبه\u200cهای او که با یک دست آویخته به گردن و بانداژ دست دیگر در بامداد ۲۸ نوامبر، ۷ آذر منتشر شده (لینک۱، لینک۲) بعد از رسیدگی پزشکی صلیب سرخ در اتوبوس انجام شده است.\nبه گفته خانواده این زندانی در گفت\u200cوگو با بی\u200cبی\u200cسی، او در همان روز ۲۸ نوامبر برای رسیدگی پزشکی به بیمارستانی در رام\u200cالله مراجعه می\u200cکنند، عکس\u200cهای رادیولوژی دستانش شکستگی را در هر دو دست نشان می\u200cداد و دکتر\u200cها گفته بودند که ممکن است نیاز به گذاشتن پلاتین باشد. ویدیوهای او با دو دست گچ گرفته شده بعد از این مراجعه به بیمارستان است. (لینک۱، لینک۲)\nواکنش اسرائیل با انتشار گفت\u200cوگوهای محمد نزال با شبکه\u200cهای الجزیره، العربیه و سایر شبکه\u200cهای خبری، اسرائیل به این اظهارات واکنش نشان دادند. اوفیر جندلمان، سخنگوی نخست وزیر اسرائیل در جهان عرب با انتشار ویدیوی محمد در لحظه آزادی که پیشتر به آن اشاره شد این ادعاها را رد کرد و نوشت: «یکی دیگر از دروغ\u200cهای فلسطینی رد شد: این محمد نزال اسیر فلسطینی است که دیروز آزاد شد. او به رسانه\u200cهای عربی گفت که زندانبانان اسرائیلی دست های او را شکستند، اما وقتی او در زندان سوار اتوبوس صلیب سرخ شد، دست\u200cهایش خوب بودند!»\nAnother Palestinian lie is debunked:\nThis is Muhammad Nazzal, a Palestinian prisoner who was released yesterday.

After posing in a dozen different jobs, adopting all the orphans in Gaza, dying and coming back to life more times than I can count, he is now living his best life in Qatar. X Link | Archive Link\nRating\nExplanation\nHundreds of civilians were killed when the Palestinian Islamist organization Hamas launched surprise attacks against Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7, 2023. In retaliation, Israel declared war on Hamas and launched an air and ground assault on Gaza, which has killed more Palestinians to date. Viral claims that associate it with the current state of warfare have been all over the internet since the conflict started.\nIn this case, the 58-second video shows a man who seems vlogging himself in an airport with a happy face in the camera. Looks like he also says hello from Qatar to his viewers. Here the user claims the man to be Mr.Pallywood and he has been posing in different jobs, adopting all the orphans in Gaza, dying and coming back to life many times, and now is living his best life in Qatar. Come on, let’s check how much truth the claim holds.\nWhat’s the truth?\nWhile analyzing the keyframes of the viral video, we found that the original video was uploaded by the YouTube channel namely ‘Saleh Aljafara’ on 22 January 2023. The video was titled in Arabic “The first flight in my life to…?” When we checked the description box of the YouTube it says that his name is Saleh Amer-Al-Jaafrawi, 26 years old, a Palestinian living in Gaza.\nCompared to the viral clip, the YouTube video is longer, clocking in at 8 minutes and 47 seconds. Upon viewing the entire video, we discovered that the viral segment was captured beginning at approximately 7 minutes and 2 seconds and extending for the subsequent 58 seconds.\nThis makes it even clearer that a tiny portion of the 10-month-old video of the Palestinian actor is being taken and shared with misleading narratives.\nConclusion:\nTherefore, we conclude that the claim Mr. Pallywood showed up in Qatar and was living his best life, is completely false. The shared video is, in fact, not recent; it dates back to early January.",

Imee Marcos said the Netherlands-based tribunal has “no jurisdiction” to conduct the investigation because of the country’s “functioning” judicial system.\nThis is misleading.\nSTATEMENT\nIn a Nov. 28 interview on CNN Philippines’ Balitaan program, news anchor Mai Rodriguez asked Marcos what she thinks about the ICC jurisdiction to investigate alleged crimes against humanity committed in the drug war during the Duterte administration.\nMarcos, who said earlier that day that she agrees that the ICC investigators should not be allowed entry into the country, replied:\n“Paulit-ulit ko nang sinasabi na talagang walang hurisdiksyon ang ICC. They have absolutely no jurisdiction in the Philippines pagka’t ang liwa-liwanag ng mga datos ng ICC, ang kanilang – ang sariling mga batay at batas ay talagang nagpapakita na ‘pag hindi umaandar at wala nang korte na nakikinig at naglilitis, eh, saka lang sila papasok.” (I have been saying repeatedly that the ICC has no jurisdiction. They have absolutely no jurisdiction in the Philippines because the ICC’s data, its own basis and rules clearly show that they only intervene if the courts are no longer working, not listening or prosecuting.)\nSource: CNN Philippines, en. Marcos: Nasa Ehekutibo kung makikipagtulungan ang PH sa ICC | Balitaan, Nov. 28, 2023, watch from 1:23 to 1:53\nThe lawmaker asserted that the judicial system in the country is “functioning” because it has allowed former senator Leila De Lima to post bail. Citing the development, Marcos said De Lima “benefited” from the country’s strong and free judiciary.\nDe Lima was released from detention on Nov. 13 after more than six years over her alleged involvement in the illegal drug trade at the national penitentiary when she was secretary of Justice.\nFACT\nThe ICC seeks to complement local justice systems, not replace them, and prosecutes cases only when states are “unable or unwilling to do so” in a genuine manner. For this reason, when the ICC resumed its full-blown investigation of the drug war, it pointed out that the Philippine government’s own drug war proceedings “do not amount to tangible, concrete and progressive investigative steps” that would sufficiently mirror ICC’s probe and justify its suspension.\n(See TRANSCRIPT: ICC probe sa drug war: Ang susunod na kabanata)\nIn its Jan. 26 decision, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I explained that investigations in the Philippines only address “the physical, low-ranking perpetrators and, at present, do not extend to any high-ranking officials.”\nThis makes Marcos one of the many public figures who have made misleading claims in asserting the Philippines’ “non-cooperation” to the ICC’s probe of the Duterte administration’s drug war.\n(Read VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Dela Rosa’s statement on ICC complementarity principle is misleading, VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Jinggoy Estrada’s statement on ICC complementarity principle misleads, VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Remulla repeats ICC jurisdiction, complementarity principle claims lacking context)\nBACKSTORY\nA Muntinlupa Regional Trial Court released De Lima and four other co-accused persons on Nov. 13 after payment of P300,000 bail each. In a 69-page decision, the court said that the testimonies of the prosecution’s witnesses were not able to establish a conspiracy among the defendants to commit illegal drug trading.\nMarcos released a statement the next day, citing De Lima’s case as a “testament” to judicial independence.\nThe lawmaker, who chairs the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, added that the case “bolsters” her position that ICC has no jurisdiction over the country, even less over former president Rodrigo Duterte.\n(Read Disinformation about ICC echoes Duterte’s defense, targets prosecutors)\nHave you seen any dubious claims, photos, memes, or online posts that you want us to verify?

Gavin Newsom — who head two of the largest states in the country — squared off in a debate on Nov. 30 on Fox News. The governors spun, mangled and exaggerated some of the facts on issues including COVID-19, migration, abortion, book bans and gasoline prices.\nThe debate, which was moderated by Sean Hannity, was billed as “The Great Red State vs. Blue State Debate.” But it wasn’t a preview of the 2024 presidential election. DeSantis is currently trailing former President Donald Trump in the polls for the Republican presidential nomination, while Newsom has ruled out challenging President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination.\nFlorida’s COVID-19 Restrictions\nIn a lively exchange on COVID-19 mitigation measures in Florida, Newsom accused DeSantis of initially supporting restrictions “until he decided to fall prey to the fringe of his party.” During that exchange, DeSantis claimed that Newsom was wrong about DeSantis closing beaches and imposing quarantines — but in both instances the California governor was right.\nNewsom: You closed down your beaches, your bars, your restaurants. DeSantis: False. Newsom: It’s a fact. DeSantis: The beaches were not closed. Newsom: You had quarantines. DeSantis: False. Newsom: You had quarantines. You had checkpoints all over the state of Florida. By the way, I didn’t say that. Donald Trump laid you out on this. Dead to rights. You did that. You followed science, you followed [Dr. Anthony] Fauci. DeSantis: That’s not true.\nIt’s true that DeSantis resisted closing beaches and issuing stay-at-home orders, but he did both in orders that were crafted in a limited way. He also directed the Florida Department of Transportation, or FDOT, to set up checkpoints in an attempt to enforce an order requiring travelers entering Florida from the New York state area to isolate for 14 days.\nHere’s a brief timeline of events that shows how DeSantis issued a series of increasingly restrictive executive orders to slow the spread of COVID-19.\nThe Florida governor issued executive order 20-68 on March 17, 2020, directing public beaches to restrict “gatherings to no more than 10 persons” and urging beachgoers to “support beach closures at the discretion of local authorities.”\nOn March 30, 2020, DeSantis signed an executive order (20-89) directing four counties in South Florida to restrict public access to “non-essential” businesses. Over the following two days, he issued two executive orders: The first (20-90) ordered beaches to be closed in Broward and Palm Beach counties, and the second (20-91) ordered senior citizens and those with a “significant underlying medical condition” statewide to stay at home. The Tampa Bay Times said that DeSantis had – up until that point — resisted issuing a statewide stay-at-home order.\nThe April 1, 2020, order, the Tampa Bay Times wrote, “does not mandate any business shut down,” but “it severely restricts the movement of employees and customers and many non-essential stores and offices will likely chose to temporarily close. Businesses are encouraged to telework and restaurants to provide food via drive-thru, take out or delivery.”\nAs for checkpoints, DeSantis issued an executive order (20-82) on March 24, 2020, ordering people entering Florida from Connecticut, New Jersey and New York “to isolate or quarantine for a period of 14 days.” He followed that up three days later with another executive order (20-86) directing FDOT to set up “appropriate checkpoints, including at welcome centers and rest stops,” and requiring travelers from those states and others areas “with substantial community spread” to fill out forms at the checkpoints disclosing “the address of their location of isolation or quarantine for a period of 14 days.”\nCalifornians Moving to Florida\nBoth governors sought to portray their states as a more desirable place to live. DeSantis emphasized Florida’s relative low overall crime rate and taxes, while Newsom countered by touting the state’s low murder rate and a progressive tax system that benefits low- and moderate-income taxpayers.\nAsked by Hannity to explain why California residents are moving to Florida, Newsom said: “You mean the last two years, more Floridians going to California than Californians going to Florida?” Newsom added, “That’s going to be fun to fact-check.”\nThe facts, however, show that Newsom is wrong to suggest that California has seen a two-year net increase in migration of residents moving between the two states.\nAccording to Census Bureau migration data for 2022, 50,701 Florida residents had been living in California the year prior, and 28,557 Californians had been living in Florida – a net gain for Florida and a net loss for California of 22,144 residents.\nIn 2021, 37,464 Florida residents had been living in California the year prior, and 24,692 California residents had been living in Florida – a net gain for Florida and a net loss for California of 12,772, Census data show.\nThat’s a two-year net gain for Florida of 34,916 new residents.\nCalifornia Gasoline Prices\nFor a variety of reasons, including higher state taxes and clean fuel mandates, California typically has among the highest gasoline prices in the United States. But DeSantis left the misleading impression that the state’s gasoline prices are currently $7 per gallon.\nThe issue of gasoline prices came up when Newsom was making a point about California’s progressive tax rate. DeSantis interjected, “How does paying $7 a gallon gas help working people?”\nGasoline prices fluctuate, and prices have reportedly topped $7 a gallon at some individual stations in the state, from time to time. But currently, the statewide average for regular gasoline in California is less than $5.\nAs of Dec. 1, a gallon of regular gasoline cost $4.83 in California, which is the highest in the country, according to AAA. The least expensive gasoline is in Texas, where the average is $2.75 a gallon. In addition to Texas, 27 other states have lower gasoline prices than Florida ($3.16 a gallon).\nBook Bans in Florida\nAs governor, DeSantis signed laws that, according to PEN America, “bar instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade (HB 1557), prohibit educators from discussing advantages or disadvantages based on race (HB 7), and mandate that schools must catalog every book on their shelves, including those found in classroom libraries (HB 1467). Due to the lack of clear guidance, these three laws have each led teachers, media specialists, and school administrators to proactively remove books from shelves, in the absence of any specific challenges.”\nDuring the debate, Newsom said “1,406 books have been banned just last year under Ron DeSantis’ leadership” – which is not quite right. PEN America reported that during the 2022–23 school year, there were 1,406 “instances of books banned” in Florida schools. Some of the books on the list are duplicates, such as Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison’s first book, “Bluest Eye,” which is listed as being banned in 12 Florida schools or school districts.\nNewsom also asked, “What’s wrong with Amanda Gorman’s [poem]?” – referring to “The Hill We Climb,” which Gorman read at Joe Biden’s inauguration. Newsom suggested that her poem was banned, and it is true that it is on PEN America’s list of banned books.\nBut, as we wrote, Gorman’s poem was not banned. In one K-8 school in Miami-Dade County, the book was moved to a shelf for upper-grade students. The school said, “The book is available in the media center as part of the middle grades collection,” meaning sixth through eighth grades.\nFlorida’s Abortion Ban\nIn April, DeSantis signed legislation, known as the Heartbeat Protection Act, that banned abortion in Florida after six weeks of gestation. A year earlier, DeSantis signed a bill that banned most abortions after 15 weeks.\nDuring a discussion on abortion, Hannity asked DeSantis about his reason for signing legislation instituting a six-week ban after he had already signed similar legislation prohibiting abortion after 15 weeks. In his response, DeSantis said of the six-week ban: “That bill attaches when there is a detectable heartbeat for the child.”\nThat is inaccurate for a couple of reasons. For the first 10 weeks, the correct medical term is “embryo,” not fetus or, as DeSantis said, “child.” Also, as we have written before, a heartbeat isn’t audible at six weeks.\n“What is interpreted as a heartbeat in these bills is actually electrically-induced flickering of a portion of the fetal tissue that will become the heart as the embryo develops,” the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement to us in 2019. “Thus, ACOG does not use the term ‘heartbeat’ to describe these legislative bans on abortion because it is misleading language, out of step with the anatomical and clinical realities of that stage of pregnancy.”\nFor more, read our Ask SciCheck “When Are Heartbeats Audible During Pregnancy?”\nAbortion Ban, Again\nNewsom repeatedly claimed that the six-week abortion ban signed by DeSantis in Florida “criminalizes women” who seek abortions. Although he did not respond to that point in the debate, DeSantis has made repeated public statements that that is not the meaning or intent of the law he signed in April.\nNewsom and other Democrats have seized on the language of the new law, which would make it a felony for “[a]ny person who willfully performs, or actively participates in, a termination of pregnancy” after six weeks of gestation. They say the inclusion of anyone who “actively participates” might subject women getting an abortion to criminal charges.\nAs we wrote last month when this issue was raised in an ad from a political action committee tied to Newsom, DeSantis has repeatedly said he does not support penalties against women who get abortions. In an interview with Norah O’Donnell on “CBS Evening News” on Sept. 13, DeSantis said the law he signed — which includes an exception for mothers whose lives are at risk, and delays the abortion ban to 15 weeks for pregnancy caused by rape, incest or human trafficking — only includes criminal penalties for medical providers who perform abortions beyond the deadlines in the law, not the women who get abortions. “We’ve litigated this,” DeSantis said.\nIn the case of Florida v. Ashley, an unwed Florida teenager was prosecuted for manslaughter and third-degree murder after she shot herself in the abdomen while in the third trimester of pregnancy. She survived, but the fetus did not. The state Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that she could not be criminally prosecuted.\nThe court noted that the penalty section of a 1993 Florida law limiting abortions in the third trimester stated, “Any person who willfully performs, or participates in, a termination of a pregnancy in violation of the requirements of this section is guilty of a felony of the third degree․” In its opinion, the state Supreme Court noted that “in order to overturn a long standing common law principle,” the state Legislature would have had to enact a statute that explicitly criminalized women who got an abortion in violation of the state statute. “Florida has not done so,” the court wrote.\nSo, since 1997, Florida has had similar language in its abortion laws, and no women getting abortions in violation of those state laws have been criminally prosecuted.\nNonetheless, on Sept. 15, Florida Senate Democratic Leader Lauren Book filed a bill citing ambiguity in the wording of the new law and proposing changes to it to make clear that women getting an abortion cannot be criminally charged. The DeSantis campaign did not respond when we asked if the governor would support Book’s bill.\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

    "maintext":"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and California Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged each other’s records on immigration, crime, COVID-19 lockdowns, the economy and social issues in a rowdy Fox News matchup billed as \"The Great Red versus Blue State Debate.\"\nDeSantis is among the Republicans running behind former President Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. Newsom, a Democrat, is not running for president — though he could be a future contender — and defended President Joe Biden’s record.\nThe governors in the debate, held in Alpharetta, Georgia, cherry-picked favorable data and talked over each other as moderator Sean Hannity flipped through topics. Newsom was telling \"a lot of whoppers,\" said DeSantis, whose props included a purported map of feces in San Francisco. (We fact-checked it at the end.)\n\"I can’t wait to get all the PolitiFacts tonight,\" Newsom said as they feuded over student learning.\nHere are our fact-checks from their showdown.\nMigration\nDeSantis and Newsom went back and forth discussing their states’ population gains and losses.\n\"He’s the first governor to ever lose population,\" said DeSantis. \"They actually at one point ran out of U-Hauls in the state of California because so many people were leaving.\"\nCalifornia’s population declined for the first time ever in 2020, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. It’s been declining since then. (Newsom became governor in 2019). After the 2020 Census, California lost a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time in its history.\nIn January 2022, U-Haul said that it ran out of one-way trucks and trailers in California at the start of 2021. This was a result of the large demand of people moving out of California in 2020, leaving fewer trucks, a U-Haul spokesperson told The Sacramento Bee.\nNewsom countered that there have been \"more Floridians coming to California than the other way around in the last two years.\"\nIf measuring per capita, Newsom is right that more Floridians have moved to California than the other way around in the last two years, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. But the difference is so small that experts have questioned whether it is meaningful.\nIn 2022, 1.32 per 1,000 Floridians moved to California, and 1.31 per 1,000 Californians moved to Florida.\nIn raw numbers, more Californians moved to Florida than the other way around. But this does not account for California\\'s higher population.\nA 2023 poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 45% of Californians who considered moving to another state cited housing costs as a factor.\nCOVID-19 lockdowns\nNewsom borrowed a page from former President Donald Trump’s playbook by misleadingly portraying DeSantis as a lockdown leader. Newsom’s comments focused on DeSantis’ actions in the pandemic’s first few weeks, when nearly all governors operated in lockstep. Newsom omits that DeSantis reopen earlier than most governors in the spring of 2020.\n\"You passed an emergency declaration before the state of California did,\" Newsom said. \"You closed down your beaches, your bars, your restaurants. It is a fact.\"\nMany local governments closed beaches for a limited time, but DeSantis did not close them statewide.\nDeSantis issued an executive order on March 17, 2020, directing Floridians to \"limit their gatherings\" at beaches to no more than 10 people and to \"support beach closures at the discretion of local authorities.\"\nHe also ordered beaches in Broward and Palm Beach counties to close for 11 days, following recommendations from local officials and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The governor\\'s refusal to close most beaches to spring break crowds drew heavy criticism and litigation.\nNewsom was on firmer ground in his claim about closing bars. DeSantis ordered all bars and nightclubs closed for 30 days. Restaurants did not close. His March 17 order said restaurants were limited to 50% customer capacity and had to separate seating by 6 feet.\nGovernors nationwide issued multiple orders in March 2020 in response to the pandemic. DeSantis issued an order March 1 to establish COVID-19 response protocol and direct a public health emergency. On March 4, Newsom declared a state of emergency to help California prepare for COVID-19.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks Nov. 9, 2023 during a Clean California event in San Francisco.

(AP)\nBook bans in Florida\nWhen Hannity asked DeSantis about the Florida bill criticized as \"don’t say gay,\" DeSantis held up a page from the graphic memoir \"Gender Queer,\" with black markings over private parts. Many Florida school districts have banned the book.\nNewsom said Florida had been on a \"book-banning binge\" under DeSantis: \"One thousand four hundred and six books have been banned just last year under Ron DeSantis’ leadership.\" DeSantis replied that it was a \"false narrative.\"\nThis stems from one group’s count and does not represent 1,406 books banned statewide.\nPEN America, a group that opposes book bans, recorded 1,406 book ban cases in Florida across about half of the state’s school districts. PEN America’s definition of a ban is more expansive than those of other groups. The organization records a book ban whenever access to a previously available book is removed or restricted — temporarily or permanently — because of parent or community challenges, administrative decisions or direct or threatened action by lawmakers or other governmental officials. Books that are removed temporarily may not return to shelves for months.\nNew Florida laws made it easier for parents to object to books, resulting in more school districts banning books in the past couple of years.\nA September Florida Department of Education report shows 20 of Florida’s 67 school districts and the statewide public Florida Virtual School removed 298 books in the 2022-23 school year. Some of those books were banned in multiple districts. Overall, school district officials received 1,218 objections about books.\nMany of the objections were for books containing sexual or LGBTQ+ content and came from a small group of parents, some affiliated with conservative groups, such as Moms for Liberty, a Tampa Bay Times analysis found.\nPrompted by Hannity to say whether the bans were state or local, DeSantis said they were \"local.\" That disguises state policy’s influence on local choices.\nNewsom also said, \"What’s wrong with Amanda Gorman’s poetry?\" suggesting it was banned. A parent at a South Florida school challenged Gorman’s poem \"The Hill We Climb,\" which Gorman performed at Biden’s January 2021 inauguration. After a review, the K-through-eighth grade school moved the book to the library’s middle school section. It was not banned at the school, much less by the district or the state.\nTax policy\nThe governors sparred about taxes, with DeSantis asking how many people leave Florida for California because that state has a lower tax burden. \"They come to Florida because they pay lower taxes,\" DeSantis said.\nBut Newsom said Florida \"taxes low-income workers more than we tax millionaires and billionaires in the state of California.\"\nNewsom has a point, although the two states have such different tax systems that it’s tricky to compare them. For instance, Florida has no income tax, but California does.\nAmong the 50 states, Florida has the nation’s 11th-lowest overall tax burden, while California has the fifth-highest, according to annual rankings by the Tax Foundation, a think tank that advocates for lower taxes.\nBut the overall tax burden doesn’t address differences between workers’ share of taxes.\nA study by the liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy examined whether state tax systems rely on higher-income taxpayers (progressive) or lower-income taxpayers (regressive). Newsom’s office said this is the study he referred to. The data, though, is from 2018.\nIt found that in California, the top 1% of households for incomes paid 12.4% of their income in state and local taxes. By comparison, in Florida, households in the bottom 20% of incomes paid 12.7% of their income in state and local taxes. By this metric, Newsom is correct.\nComparing the tax burden for the lowest 20% of households in income, California also has lower taxes. In California, households in the bottom 20% paid 10.5% of their income in taxes, compared with Florida’s 12.7%.\nMeanwhile, wealthy taxpayers came out ahead in Florida, where the tax burden for the top 1% was 2.3% of income. That’s far lower than the 12.4% rate for California millionaires.\nFlorida’s crime rate\nAs DeSantis described a conversation with Newsom’s father-in-law, who moved to Florida, he claimed Florida was experiencing a \"50-year low\" in the crime rate. Newsom said DeSantis’ \"own law enforcement\" said the data shouldn’t be used.\nWhat used to be an easy talking point about Florida’s declining crime became controversial this year after the agency changed how it reported its crime rate.\nNBC News reported Sept. 20 that DeSantis’ talking point came from a database with information from law enforcement agencies representing about 57% of Florida’s population. The story quoted three unnamed former Florida Department of Law Enforcement staff members who said they had warned top officials against using the \"50-year low\" claim, because it was impossible to verify.\nFlorida’s transitioned to incident-based crime reporting, the new federal standard, rather than the summary-based reports it has used since the 1970s. With summary reporting, if one incident resulted in multiple crimes, only the most serious crimes would be reported. In 2021, the federal government stopped accepting this type of data and now requires states to report each crime.\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement told PolitiFact in September that the 50-year low statistic still holds after additional agencies submitted data, representing around 75% of the population.\nThe FBI’s crime reporting database shows that 49 of 757 Florida law enforcement agencies participated in the FBI’s data collection in 2021. By contrast, in 2022, 367 Florida law enforcement agencies sent in data.\nFlorida’s abortion limits and DeSantis’ abortion survivor story\nAs Hannity pressed Newsom on whether he supported any abortion restrictions, Newsom attacked Florida’s abortion laws.\n\"He signed a bill banning any exceptions for rape and incest,\" Newsom said of DeSantis. \"And then he said it didn\\'t go far enough and decided to sign a six-week ban … that criminalizes women and criminalizes doctors.\"\nDeSantis signed legislation in 2022 that outlawed abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. It does not make exceptions for cases of incest, rape or human trafficking but includes an exception for the mother’s life.\nDeSantis signed a stricter bill in April that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Whether the law takes effect hinges on how the Florida Supreme Court rules in a lawsuit against the current 15-week ban. The 2023 law does contain exceptions, including to save the woman’s life or in cases of fatal fetal anomalies. Abortions for pregnancies involving rape, incest or human trafficking would be allowed until 15 weeks of pregnancy if a woman has documentation, such as a restraining order, police report or medical record.\nThe law penalizes physicians, but whether it also criminalizes women is less clear, so we have rated a similar claim Half True. The law says that anyone who \"actively participates in\" an abortion commits a third-degree felony, which opens the door to prosecutors charging women, but we don’t yet know whether they will or how courts would respond to such charges. DeSantis has also said that he doesn’t want women prosecuted, only doctors.\nDefending the law, DeSantis repeated an anecdote from the first GOP presidential debate about a Floridian named Penny Hopper. Hopper is a real person, and an anti-abortion activist. Some of the details about her birth story have been called into question.\nHopper said she survived an abortion attempt in Florida in 1955. Her claim has been featured by anti-abortion groups and used to support \"born alive\" bills in state legislatures, which aim to protect infants who survive abortions, even though there are federal laws for that purpose.\nIn a video and in interviews, Hopper said she had been delivered around 23 weeks gestation after her mother went to a hospital in Wauchula, Florida, while experiencing bleeding. Hopper said the doctor induced labor, and she was born at 1 pound, 11 ounces, and that the doctor told staff to discard her \"dead or alive.\" She said her grandmother found her the next day on the hospital porch in a bedpan. Then, Hopper said, a nurse volunteered to take her to a larger hospital that was about 40 miles away.\nThat a baby born at 23 weeks could survive overnight without medical attention in 1955 is medically dubious, experts said. From the 1950s through 1980, \"newborn death was virtually ensured\" for infants born at or before 24 weeks of gestation, The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology says on its website.\nThe Washington Post also reported that contemporaneous newspaper accounts offer a different scenario at the hospital, and said the staff spent days keeping her alive before arranging a police escort to rush her to another hospital.\nFlorida Gov.

Ron DeSantis speaks Nov. 8, 2023, during a Republican presidential primary debate in Miami. (AP)\nLiteracy rates and learning loss\nDeSantis and Newsom each said their state handled education better during the pandemic.\nDeSantis said that in the most recent results of a widely tracked standardized test, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, \"Florida came in No. 3 for fourth grade reading. California was far, far behind.\"\nThis is accurate. Florida ranked third among states for fourth grade reading, after Massachusetts and Wyoming. California ranked 32nd.\nOn eighth grade reading, Florida ranked 21st, but still led California, which ranked 29th.\nNewsom, meanwhile, said, \"Ron DeSantis had more learning loss during COVID\" in Florida than he had in California.\nMeasuring learning loss is complicated and varies by academic subject and age. But one study that tried to quantify how much students backslid overall during the pandemic supports Newsom’s statement.\nIn January 2023, McKinsey & Co., a consulting company, released a study of how National Assessment of Educational Progress results changed in each state from 2019 to 2022.\nIn the study, a 4-point drop in scores on the test was estimated to have produced 12 weeks of learning delay. Learning loss varied widely by state, with Hawaii and Alabama experiencing four weeks of loss and Delaware experiencing 32 weeks.\nThe study found that California students lost an average of nine weeks, compared with 12 weeks for Florida. That put California slightly below the 12-week national average and Florida slightly above it.\nDeSantis criticized California for having \"one of the lowest literacy rates in the country.\" He is correct — but he ignored that Florida’s literacy rate is nearly as low.\nThe federal Education Department uses a few metrics to measure literacy. The most comprehensive, calculated by modeling several measurements of literacy, has a fairly narrow range, from 252 (the lowest, for Louisiana) to 279 (the highest, for New Hampshire).\nCalifornia has the sixth-lowest score of any state (257). But Florida has the ninth-lowest score at 259.\nViolent crime statistics\nHannity said California’s levels of violent crime are \"way higher than the national average.\" He showed a graphic with 2022 violent crime rates, based on FBI data. California had the highest rate, with 499.5 violent crimes per 100,000 people. The national average was 380.7 per 100,000, and Florida’s was 258.9 per 100,000. We checked the numbers in the graphic and found they were accurate.\nNewsom pushed back on this narrative by focusing on one category of violent crime: murders. The other types of violent crime include forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.\n\"Seven of the top 10 murder rates in the United States of America are red states,\" Newsom said.\nNewsom is right, based on the voting patterns in the 2020 presidential election and 2020 state-by-state homicide rankings, according to an analysis of federal data by Third Way, a center-left policy group.\nIn descending order, the top 10 states for homicide rates were Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Missouri, Arkansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Illinois, Maryland and Georgia. The first seven on that list all supported Trump in the 2020 election; the final three supported President Joe Biden. The analysis also found that \"solidly red states have dominated the top 10 murder rate states for the past decade\" or more.\nNewsom also said that Florida \"has a 66% higher gun death rate than the state of California.\"\nThis is close. According to 2020 federal data, Florida’s gun death rate was 14.1 per 100,000 residents, compared with 9.0 per 100,000 in California. That’s 57% higher for Florida.\nHowever, both governors can point to other statistics to bolster their case as the safer locale.\nCalifornia’s overall homicide rate of 5.7 per 100,000 people was higher than Florida’s rate of 5.0 per 100,000. Both states rank below the national rate of 6.3.\nFlorida’s gun homicide rate, 5.87 per 100,000, was higher than California’s, 4.65.\nAmericans in Israel\nDeSantis did not tell the full story of how the Biden administration evacuated Americans from Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack.\n\"Biden stranded a lot of American citizens over there who were trying to get home,\" DeSantis said. \"So, I did an executive order in Florida, and we sent planes over Israel right in the aftermath of Oct. 7, and we saved over 700 Americans, mostly Floridians, but not all, because Biden wouldn’t do it.\"\nAbout 700 Americans flew to Florida on four flights from Israel, DeSantis’ office said. The flights were free for passengers.\nBut the Biden administration also brought Americans home. It offered 6,900 seats to Americans in Israel seeking to depart by air, land or sea. As of Oct. 31, about 1,500 U.S. citizens and their family members had departed using federal government transport, a State Department spokesperson previously told PolitiFact.\nThe first flight landed in Athens, Greece. News reports said that the State Department flew Americans to European cities where they could book flights to the U.S. on commercial airlines. Florida officials offered to transport Americans who were in Athens to the U.S.\nPer long-standing federal law and policy, the government seeks reimbursement from citizens for the cost of transportation.\nSquabbling over Special Olympics\nDeSantis and Newsom sparred over how the other treated the Special Olympics. Newsom said it was \"disgraceful\" that DeSantis threatened to fine the Special Olympics $27 million.\nDeSantis fired back that Newsom \"wanted the athletes marginalized.\"\nWhat were they talking about?\nIn June 2022, ahead of a planned Special Olympics event in Orlando, the Florida Department of Health told the organization that its vaccine requirement conflicted with state law barring any business from asking for proof of COVID-19 vaccination. After Florida threatened to fine the Special Olympics $27 million, the organization eliminated its vaccine requirement.\nFlorida’s action prompted \"an emotional response\" for Newsom, he told the Sacramento Bee. He tweeted: \"Ron DeSantis’ values on full display: Bullying. The. Special. Olympics.\"\nIn response, DeSantis emphasized how lifting the vaccine requirement enabled some participants to participate in the games even though health concerns prevented them from getting vaccinated. He cited participants such as Isabella Valle, who has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and a shunt in her brain.\nBoth governors have ties to the Special Olympics. Newsom headed the leadership committee for the Special Olympics’ World Games in Los Angeles in 2015, and his mother helped families adopt children with disabilities, the Bee reported.\nDeSantis and his wife, Casey were honorary co-chairs of the 2022 Special Olympics.\nMapping human feces in San Francisco\nDuring a conversation about homelessness, DeSantis pulled out a sheet of paper from his suit jacket and revealed a map of San Francisco filled with brown and black pinpoint icons.\nDuring Red vs. Blue State #debate, @RonDeSantis showed @GavinNewsom our map of human feces all over San Francisco. It\\'s just one of the many ways we track what you get for your tax $! Get the whole story here: https://t.co/XEKr29GXKE #transparencymatters https://t.co/jk47bNwDDE — OpenTheBooks (@open_the_books) December 1, 2023\n\"Well, this is an app where they plot the human feces that are found on the streets of San Francisco,\" said DeSantis. \"And you see how almost the whole thing is covered? Because that is what has happened in one of the previous greatest cities this country\\'s ever had. Human feces is now a fact of life.\"\nDeSantis’ map comes from Open the Books, a nonprofit government watchdog. But what DeSantis pointed to isn’t current.\nThe map plotted public reports of human feces found in San Francisco from 2011 to 2019. (More than 118,000 people reported their findings to San Francisco’s nonemergency line.)\nNewsom was San Francisco mayor from 2004 to 2011 and was California’s lieutenant governor from 2011 to 2019.\nOpen the Books does not seem to have a map of current data. But there is another map created by two Los Angeles teachers, showing reports from July 2019 to July 2020. That map has fewer data points than the visual DeSantis offered.\nRELATED: The Ron DeSantis and Gavin Newsom economies, in 8 charts",

    "maintext":"Boato – Vazou um áudio de Flávio Dino na CNN sobre a PL 2630, economia, desemprego, Bolsonaro e redes sociais.\nAnálise\nEstamos em um tempo no qual a tendência é que o nome do ministro da Justiça e Segurança Pública Flávio Dino fique cada vez mais constante em conteúdos falsos na internet. Uma das histórias que está viralizando aponta para um suposto áudio atribuído a ele.\nCom legendas como “vasou áudio do Dino CNN Brasil 30/11/2023”, “vai vendo Brasil veja se não é isto que está acontecendo vaza áudio. Dino Não! Compartilhe antes que caiam”, “estou horrorizado, mas não surpreso”. Leia a transcrição:\nEssa PL, vinte e seis trinta, por exemplo, é uma delas que nos deixará muito fortalecidos. Então, quais são os nossos objetivos? Além de arruinar a economia, é aumentar o desemprego, destruir o comércio, deixar o povo desaparecido, falir as empresas, falir também o agronegócio, invadir terras, controlar o exército, desmobilizar as polícias, desarmar o cidadão de bem, criar uma guarda nacional com presidiários libertos, aparelhar tribunais de contas com parentes, esposas dos nossos companheiros, pagar a mídia para distorcer os fatos e subjugar o povo pelo medo de se expressar, pelo medo de ser cancelado ou até de ser preso. Eu pergunto aos senhores, quem é o nosso maior inimigo?\nNão é o Bolsonaro? Senhor, nosso maior inimigo não é o Bolsonaro. O nosso maior inimigo são as redes sociais, porque as redes sociais expõem a verdade sobre o nosso governo. Entenda uma coisa, senhor, o Bolsonaro sem as redes sociais não nos causa nada, é inofensivo. Mas as redes sociais sem o Bolsonaro, elas são danosas ao nosso governo porque expõe a verdade. Ou seja, não adianta nós tentarmos eliminar Bolsonaro sem eliminar as redes sociais.\nSe nós eliminarmos ou controlarmos as redes sociais, automaticamente nós eliminamos Bolsonaro. Entendam, a verdade é inimiga do nosso governo. Já fazemos isso através da mídia e da imprensa, que nós temos o controle, mas não é o suficiente. Nós estamos com o país dividido e não pode haver essa divisão. Então nós temos que trabalhar para alcançar o nosso maior objetivo. E somente o nosso discurso possa prosperar.\nChecagem\nNa parte da checagem do conteúdo, vamos responder às seguintes questões: 1) É verdade que o áudio que circulou na internet é de Flávio Dino e foi vazado para a CNN? 2) O que Flávio Dino diz sobre o assunto? 3) Há alguma verdade no conteúdo do áudio que viralizou?\nÉ verdade que o áudio que circulou na internet é de Flávio Dino e foi vazado para a CNN?\nNão é verdade. Para começar, não há qualquer indício de que a CNN tenha divulgado o tal áudio. Além disso, a voz do cidadão que gravou o áudio não é a de Flávio Dino. Na realidade, tratou-se de uma imitação (não tão bem feita). Além disso, o próprio ministro desmentiu a publicação.\nO que Flávio Dino diz sobre o assunto?\nPor meio de suas redes sociais, o ministro desmentiu a autoria do áudio. Em publicação no Twitter, ele escreveu o seguinte: “Registro a minha indignação com a campanha abjeta que estão fazendo, a exemplo dessa grosseira falsificação. A prova da falsidade é evidente, à luz do conteúdo estapafúrdio e do estilo ridículo com que o discurso é proferido”. Ou seja: ele denunciou que não falou o que está dito.\nHá alguma verdade no conteúdo do áudio que viralizou?\nComo o próprio Flávio Dino disse, ele classificou o conteúdo como “estapafúrdio”. Há uma distorção em, no mínimo, dois pontos. O primeiro é o que aponta que o PL 2630 não passa de uma forma de “controlar as redes sociais”. Na realidade, se trata de uma proposta que visa regulamentar o uso dela. A segunda é a que fala que o governo está arruinando a economia. Os últimos indicadores mostram o contrário disso.\nConclusão\nFake news ❌\nO áudio que está circulando na internet não foi revelado pela CNN e não é de autoria do ministro da Justiça Flávio Dino. Trata-se de mais uma fake news que circula online.\nPs: Esse artigo é uma sugestão de leitores do Boatos.org.

L'une a été photographiée en 2011 en Cisjordanie, et l'autre en 2014 dans la bande de Gaza. Selon les informations disponibles, l'âne mort a été tué dans une frappe israélienne.\nFaits\nUne recherche d'image inversée sur différents moteurs de recherche permet de retrouver l'origine des deux photos. On constate ainsi qu'elles ne montrent pas le même animal, et qu'elles n'illustrent pas le conflit actuel entre le Hamas et Israël.\nLa première, disponible sur Getty Images, a été prise le 23 septembre 2011 dans le village de Kafr Qaddum, situé en Cisjordanie. D'autres clichés du même âne, photographiés le même jour, figurent sur différentes banques d'images (par exemple ici, ici, ici, ici et ici).\nSelon les légendes qui les accompagnent, l'âne en question avait été peint aux couleurs du drapeau israélien dans le cadre d'une manifestation soutenant la demande d'adhésion de l'Autorité palestinienne aux Nations unies (ONU). Cette demande, à laquelle Israël s'était opposé, avait finalement été rejetée. En 2012, l'ONU avait toutefois décidé d'accorder « à la Palestine le statut d'Etat non membre observateur ».\nLa deuxième photo est également disponible sur Getty Images. Elle date du 6 août 2014 et montre le corps d'un âne en feu à Rafah, une ville dans la bande de Gaza située à plus de 130 kilomètres de Kafr Qaddum. D'après la légende, des Palestiniens avaient décidé de brûler l'animal après que celui-ci a été tué dans une frappe israélienne quelques jours auparavant.\nLa Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa) n'a pas été en mesure de retrouver d'autres photos de cet âne. Mais, début août 2014, la ville de Rafah a en effet été bombardée de manière intensive par Israël, comme l'a notamment documenté l'ONG Amnesty International. D'autres images sur Getty prouvent que le photographe à l'origine du cliché de l'âne mort, Abed Rahim Khatib, se trouvait bien à Rafah le 6 août 2014.\nLes deux images ont donc été prises à deux moments et deux endroits différents, et ne montrent pas une quelconque rétribution du camp palestinien à l'encontre d'Israël.\n(Situation au 01.12.2023)",

In der aktuellen Nahost-Krise behaupten User in sozialen Netzwerken nun: Israel sei so unter Druck, dass es die ersten drei Ziffern der Barcodes heimischer Produkte geändert habe, um Boykottaufrufen zu entgehen. Ist das so und würde das etwas nützen?\nBewertung\nDie ersten drei Ziffern eines Barcodes sind kein zuverlässiger Indikator für die Herkunft eines Produktes. Sie geben lediglich Auskunft darüber, in welchem Land der Barcode beantragt worden ist.\nFakten\nUm ein Produkt in den den weltweiten Handel zu bringen, muss es mit einem Strichcode beziehungsweise einem «GTIN» versehen werden. Diese werden über das globale Netzwerk «GS1» vergeben, das etwa auch in Österreich die offizielle Vergabestelle für Strichcodes darstellt.\nLaut Informationen auf der Homepage des Unternehmens geben die ersten drei Ziffern im Barcode, der sogenannte «GS1 Prefix», keine Information darüber, aus welchem Land ein Produkt kommt. Es handle sich lediglich um die Kennung der Mitgliedsorganisation, die den Code vergeben hat.\nIn der viralen Behauptung auf Facebook wird behauptet, dass Israel die Ziffer von 729 auf 871 geändert hätte. 729 ist tatsächlich die Kennziffer für Produkte, die in Israel registriert worden sind. 871 wären Produkte, deren GS1-Nummern in den Niederlanden vergeben worden sind.\nLaut dem französischen Nachrichtenmagazin «L'Obs» zirkulierte diese Behauptung schon im Jahr 2014 und ging wohl auf SodaStream zurück, einen israelischer Hersteller von Trinkwassersprudlern. User hätten Fotos des Strichcodes an SodaStream-Geräten online gestellt und dem Unternehmen vorgeworfen, seine Produkte fälschlicherweise mit niederländischen Codes zu versehen. In Wirklichkeit hat das Unternehmen einfach ein Tochterunternehmen in den Niederlanden.\nEs handelt sich somit nicht nur um eine falsche Behauptung, sondern darüber hinaus auch um eine sehr alte, die jetzt im aktuellen Konflikt zwischen Israel und der Hamas wieder hervorgeholt worden ist. Schon im Jahr 2021 hatte AFP einen Faktencheck dazu veröffentlicht.\n(Stand: 30.11.2023)",

    "maintext":"Clips edited and shared as Spanish football fans supporting Palestine\nBy: Ishita Goel\nDecember 1 2023 Share Article:\nFact-Check The Verdict False The video is from a stadium in Morocco and shows matches between two clubs from the region. There is no mention of Palestine in the video. Claim ID a9c5b5f3\nWhat is the claim?\nA viral video on social media of a stadium with fans holding red flares and torches, waving different flags, and singing in Spanish is being shared online. Accompanying claims state that it shows a football stadium in Spain and that the match-goers are singing in support of Palestine. The inlaid text in Arabic reads, \"A wonderful scene of the solidarity of the Spanish people for the cause in the stadium\" and \"We don\\'t want to see a football game; we want to go to Palestine.\"\nX (formerly Twitter) (archived here) and Facebook (archived here) users shared the video with captions that said, \"*Spain*_ In the football stadium, everyone shouted with one voice; We don\\'t want to watch football, but we want to go and help Palestine !\" Other links to the archived posts are here, here, and here.\nScreenshots of the viral posts on X. (Source: X/Modified by Logically Facts)\nWhat are the facts?\nWe found the video comprises two clips of different football matches, the first lasting from 0:00 to 0:37 and the second, after an obvious transition, from 0:38 to 0:45.\nThrough a reverse image search, we found a longer version of the same video on TikTok dated November 7, 2023, posted with the caption \"Raja Casablanca.\" Raja Casablanca is a commonly used name for the Raja Club Athletic Beausejour football club based in Casablanca, Morocco. Using this information, we found a fan page of Raja Casablanca, which posted the same video on TikTok on November 2 with the description \"Somos Curva Sud.\" Somos Curva Sud is a song by La Voce Della Magana.\nVideo found on TikTok. (Source: TikTok/ScreenshotsModified by Logically Facts)\nWhat does the song say?\nCMF Radio (Call Me Fred Radio), a London-based radio explains that \"The lyrics are about a group of fans supporting their soccer team (referred to as \"champion\" and \"player\"), specifically the group known as \"Curva Sud.\" Similarly, another music website, Genius, writes that the song of the Curva Sud Casablanca has become a \"true symbol of unity and solidarity among football supporters around the world.\"\nWe compared the Spanish lyrics from the viral clip to the original song posted by La Voce Della Magana on YouTube and matched the words from the 1:32 mark to the viral clip. Further, we translated the lyrics into English and found no mention of any support for Palestine. The lyrics say, \"It\\'s a crazy life,\" carry words of encouragement like \"come on,\" and mention the drugs marijuana and cocaine.\nThe first clip\nUsing the keywords \"Somos Curva Sud\" and \"Raja Casablanca,\" we came across an Instagram account called \"Somos Curva Sud,\" a page dedicated to the club, which shared the same video on July 10 with a different song being sung by the audience. When comparing this footage to that seen in the viral video, the flags are in the same order, and there is a banner that reads \"Green Boys.\" The stadium\\'s structure is the same, and a group of policemen can be seen in front of the stands.\nComparison of an image from Instagram to the viral clip. (Source: Instagram/YouTube/ScreenshotsModified by Logically Facts)\nUsing the date of the video, we found that Raja Casablanca played Wydad AC in the semi-final of the Moroccan Throne Cup on July 9, 2023, at the Mohammed V Sports Complex in Casablanca. We compared the stadium in the viral clip to photos of the Mohammed V Sports Complex and confirmed that the match was held in Morocco and not in Spain, as claimed.\nComparison of an image from the website to the viral clip. (Source: Website/YouTube/ScreenshotsModified by Logically Facts)\nWe found several videos uploaded by the same account between July 9 and July 10 that captured the scoreboard in the stadium, which showed the score WAC 0 and RAC 1 with the timer reading 90 minutes, the result of the semi-final. This further suggested that the viral footage was from the July 9 game.\nFurther, we found that a YouTube page, O Show das Torcidas, posted a video of the Wydad vs Raja Casablanca semi-final on July 10, 2023. At 2:13, we can see a group of 4-5 policemen directly in front of the stands, near a yellow railing, as seen in the viral video. Various other features of the crowd also match the viral video. The description read that the stadium was filled with Wydad and Raja Casablanca fans. Here, the song sung by the audience is the same as the video uploaded to the Instagram page, suggesting that the audio of the viral video has been altered to overlay the \"Somos Curva Sud\\' song.\nThe first clip is from July and, therefore, predates and is unrelated to the Israel-Hamas conflict. No reports suggest any chants or songs supporting Palestine featured at this match.\nComparison of an image from YouTube to the viral clip. (Source: X/YouTube/ScreenshotsModified by Logically Facts)\nThe second clip\nAs the viral clip carried blurry and brief visuals for the second clip, we used the longer TikTok video to trace the game. We found the second clip is from a Raja Casablanca match against Moghreb Atletico Tetouan Club, held on October 8, 2023.\nWe found a YouTube page, \"zemama35,\" posted a video on October 9, 2023, showing a part of the Raja Casablanca vs. Moghreb Athletic de Tétouan match. At 2:00, we can see the exact text in Arabic on the perimeter strip, the yellow stand, and some people cheering. Further, we matched the crowd on the ground, including police and staff, an attendee waving his arms and celebrating, and another attendee recording a video on their phone that was seen in the viral clip.\nComparison of a screenshot from YouTube to the viral clip. (Source: X/YouTube/ScreenshotsModified by Logically Facts)\nSimilarly, the account ZAMANEPRESSE posted a YouTube video on October 9, 2023, with an angle that matched a frame of the viral video. At the 0:44 mark of this YouTube video, we can match the words in Arabic, and the yellow stands to 0:41 in the viral clip.\nThe song the crowd sang in both videos differed from the viral video.\nA report by Middle East Eye dated October 10 said that during the match, fans of Raja Casablanca cheered and raised flags in support of Palestine. A part of the audience also sang a song in support of Palestine.\nWe found that the match seen in the second clip was also held at the Mohammed V stadium in Morocco, and although a pro-Palestine song was featured at a point, the viral clip doesn\\'t show that part.\nThe verdict\nAnalyzing the viral video, we found that two clips from two football matches have been edited with overlaid audio. However, neither game was held in Spain, nor did they show Spanish football fans. The overlaid song also does not refer to Palestine. Therefore, we have marked this claim false.",

    "maintext":"In het conflict tussen Israël en Hamas beschuldigen beide kanten elkaar van het veroorzaken van onnoemelijk menselijk leed. Nu doet er online echter een fotocollage de ronde die moet aantonen dat Palestijnen ook dieren mishandelen. Een ezel zou beschilderd zijn met de Israëlische vlag en vervolgens gestenigd en in brand gestoken. Moest het dier de woede van de Palestijnse bevolking bekopen of is er wat anders aan de hand?\nBeoordeling\nDe foto's tonen twee verschillende ezels. De ene ezel is op de Westelijke Jordaanoever gefotografeerd in 2011, de andere in de Gazastrook in 2014. De dode ezel zou zijn omgekomen bij een Israëlische luchtaanval.\nFeiten\nBeide dieren hebben een witte vacht, en door beide foto's onder elkaar te plaatsen is het een normale reactie om ze meteen met elkaar in verband te brengen. Een zoektocht met reverse image search leert echter snel dat het hier gaat om twee verschillende dieren die niets met elkaar te maken hebben, of met het huidige conflict.\nDe foto van de beschilderde ezel is terug te vinden bij Getty Images. Het beeld werd gemaakt op 23 september 2011 in Kafr Qaddum, een dorp op de Westelijke Jordaanoever. Meerdere foto's van dezelfde ezel zijn bij verschillende fotoagentschappen te vinden, die allen het beeld op 23 september 2011 dateren (hier, hier, hier, hier en hier).\nVolgens het bijschrift toont de foto een demonstratie ter gelegenheid van de Palestijnse aanvraag tot VN-lidmaatschap diezelfde dag. Dat werd niet goedgekeurd, maar in 2012 verkreeg Palestina wel het statuut van waarnemerstaat niet-lid.\nDe tweede foto is ook terug te vinden bij Getty Images. Dat beeld werd echter drie jaar later, op 6 augustus 2014, bij Rafah in de Gazastrook gemaakt. Volgens het bijschrift toont de foto een ezel die in brand is gestoken nadat het dier was omgekomen bij een Israëlisch bombardement, een aantal dagen eerder.\nIn de zomer van 2014 werd Rafah daadwerkelijk intensief gebombardeerd door Israël. Hoewel Deutsche Presse-Agentur geen andere beelden van de overleden ezel vond, tonen andere foto's bij Getty dat de fotograaf, Abed Rahim Khatib, zich op 6 augustus 2014 in Rafah bevond. Dat is zo'n 130 kilometer zuidoostelijker dan Kafr Qaddum, waar de eerste foto genomen werd.\n(Stand van zaken: 01.12.2023)",

    "maintext":"Claim\nKarnataka: Muslims giving their natural treatment to Hindus for gathering before a temple. An aggressive, ruthless religion + a highly partial government. HINDUS of Telangana, please cast your vote WISELY….. Because Ms are going to vote VERY WISELY. Twitter Link | Archive Link | Archive 2\nRating\nExplanation\nPeople in Telangana have voted in their Assembly elections on 30th November 2023. Several opinion polls suggest that Indian National Congress (INC) might have a slight edge over the ruling Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). During the initial stages of the election cycle, it was projected as BJP would be the main contender against the ruling BRS headed by K.Chandrashekar Rao (KCR). However, Congress quickly gained ground and emerged as the challenger to KCR’s Government which has been in power since the inception of the state in 2014.\nIn the week prior to the polling day, several posts in social media claimed that Muslims in Karnataka are beating up Hindus and are taking over temples. This has come with a warning to voters that if Congress ends up getting the power, this would be the condition Hindus would be subjected to live and asked voters of Telangana to consider this before they vote. A BJP supporter from Andhra Pradesh too shared a similar post with a longer video on 22 November 2023.\nWhat’s the truth?\nFrom the viral tweet which has garnered over 60 thousand views at the time of writing this, we were able to ascertain that people are speaking Marathi. This prompted us to narrow our search to northern parts of Karnataka or Maharashtra. With some keywords search, we were able to find out that the video is indeed from Maharashtra.\nWhen we searched further, we came across a news article from TV 9 Hindi’s website along with a video. From that video, we are able to confirm that the incident is from Kanifnath Temple in Guha Village, Ahmednagar. Here’s a side-by-side comparison to show that the viral video and the TV9 Hindi’s video were taken in the temple in Maharashtra.\nAnother video showing the incident was present in a similar reporting by News 18 Lokmat.\nAccording to a report from the Hindustan Times which reported on this clash, Muslims and Hindus clashed over the sound of loudspeakers used during a pooja. The Kanfinath temple and a dargah are located with close proximity to one another both of which claims ownership of the land and the matter is pending in Court as per the report.\nSo, a video from Maharashtra which is ruled by BJP-Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction) alliance is used to falsely claim that it is from Congress ruled Karnataka. This was used to claim similar incidents will take place in Telangana if Congress comes to power in the state and asked Hindus to vote ‘wisely’.\nConclusion\nThe viral video is not from Karnataka. It is from Maharashtra where BJP-Shiv Sena (Eknath Shinde faction) Alliance is in power. It is used by many right-wingers to falsely claim that the video is from Congress ruled Karnataka when Muslims attacked Hindus during a temple pooja. This was done with a malicious intent to create communal disharmony and also to dissuade Hindus from voting for the Congress party in Telangana elections.",

    "maintext":"Drie jaar na de groepsverkrachting van een 15-jarig meisje in het stadspark van Hamburg, is het proces over de feiten afgerond. Online wordt verontwaardigd gereageerd omdat de beschuldigden zouden zijn vrijgesproken. Dat is echter niet wat de rechter besloten heeft.\nBeoordeling\nNegen van de tien verdachten werden tot gevangenisstraffen veroordeeld. Een dader moet naar de gevangenis, in andere gevallen zijn de straffen voorwaardelijk of wordt later besloten of er sprake zal zijn van een gevangenisstraf.\nFeiten\nDe jeugdkamer van de Regionale rechtbank van Hamburg veroordeelde op 28 november negen jonge mannen tot gevangenisstraffen voor de feiten die in september 2020 plaatsvonden. Een tiende verdachten werd vrijgesproken, een elfde was al op 5 april vrijgesproken.\nIn tegenstelling tot wat online de ronde doet, was er voor 9 verdachten dus helemaal geen vrijspraak, want de verdachten werden wel degelijk veroordeeld; de rechter acht hen schuldig. Eén 19-jarige werd veroordeeld tot twee jaar en negen maanden gevangenisstraf zonder voorwaardelijke vrijlating.\nVan de andere acht veroordeelden kregen er vier een voorwaardelijke gevangenisstraf tot maximum twee jaar. Vier anderen kregen een straf met 'Vorbewährung'. Dit is een regeling in het Duitse rechtssysteem die enkel voor jeugddelinquenten mogelijk is, en waarbij de rechter de strafbepaling uitstelt tot na een proeftijd, in dit geval zes maanden. De veroordeelden en hun ontwikkeling worden in deze proeftijd opgevolgd en na afloop beslist de rechter pas over de strafmaat.\nHiermee voldoet de rechter aan de strafmaat die door de aanklager geëist werd. De advocaten van de verdachten hadden de vrijspraak gevraagd; iets wat de rechter in haar vonnis absurd noemde.\nControversiële zaak\nDe zaak draaide rond de groepsverkrachting van een 15-jarig meisje in het stadspark van Hamburg in september 2020. Het park was een populaire ontmoetingsplaats geworden tijdens de coronaperiode. Het slachtoffer was die avond erg dronken geworden en daar werd door verschillende groepen mannen misbruik van gemaakt om haar mee in bosjes te nemen en tegen haar wil seks met haar te hebben.\nDe zaak leidde tot veel controverse in Duitsland, wat ook het proces onder druk zette. Sperma met DNA van de veroordeelden werd op het slachtoffer aangetroffen, maar er was geen rechtstreeks bewijs van verkrachting of sporen van geweld. De verdediging argumenteerde dan ook dat de seksuele handelingen met wederzijdse toestemming gebeurd waren.\nTot en met 2016 zouden de daders zijn vrijgesproken aangezien seksuele handelingen voor de wet in Duitsland tot dan enkel verkrachting waren wanneer er sprake was van bedreiging of geweld. Maar sinds de wet op seksuele misdrijven is aangescherpt, kunnen seksuele handelingen ook een misdrijf zijn wanneer het slachtoffer niet meer in staat is om een wil of (het weigeren van) toestemming uit te drukken. Die laatste redenering volgde de rechter dan ook in dit proces.\n(Stand van zaken: 01.12.2023)",

    "maintext":"Le président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky serait apparu dans une campagne encourageant à arrêter la drogue. C'est en tout cas ce que laisse entendre une vidéo partagée depuis la mi-novembre sur les réseaux sociaux, comme ici, ici et ici sur Facebook ou encore ici sur la plateforme VK. Selon les internautes, après que le rappeur Snoop Dogg aurait annoncé arrêter de se droguer, des centres de désintoxication américains auraient diffusé des publicités sur les écrans géants de New York. Le visage de Volodymyr Zelensky figurerait parmi « les toxicomanes », à en croire la vidéo. Mais s'agit-il d'une réelle campagne de sensibilisation ?\nÉvaluation\nIl n'existe aucune preuve indiquant que cette soi-disant campagne de sensibilisation soit authentique. La compagnie gérant les publicités diffusées sur l'écran géant en question a assuré à la Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa) qu'il s'agissait d'une fausse vidéo.\nFaits\nLa vidéo montre bel et bien un endroit à New York, plus précisément dans le célèbre quartier de Times Square. On retrouve facilement l'emplacement grâce à l'hôtel Marriott Marquis, ainsi qu'aux magasins Sephora et T-Mobile, visibles sur les images.\nL'écran géant qui se trouve sur la façade du bâtiment appartient à la société Vornado Realty Trust et est exploité par l'agence de publicité Silvercast. Contacté par la dpa, le co-fondateur de Silvercast, Gary Grossman, a qualifié la vidéo de « 100% fausse ».\nA la fin de la présumée campagne de sensibilisation avec Volodymyr Zelensky, le logo d'un centre de désintoxication appelé Wish Recovery apparaît. Celui-ci est situé dans une autre ville américaine, Los Angeles. Cependant, on ne trouve nulle trace de cette vidéo sur ses réseaux sociaux ; ni sur Facebook, X, Instagram, LinkedIn ou YouTube. Il est donc possible que le logo du centre ait été utilisé sans l'autorisation de ce dernier. Wish Recovery n'a pas répondu aux requêtes de la dpa dans l'immédiat.\nL'origine de cette vidéo reste incertaine. Une recherche d'image inversée permet de la retrouver sur différentes plateformes en russe (entre autres ici, ici, ici et ici), à partir du 18 novembre 2023. Les autres publicités présentes sur l'écran, notamment pour le film « The Marvels » ou le jeu vidéo « Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III », suggèrent que les images sont assez récentes - tous deux sont sortis le 10 novembre 2023. La publicité pour une chanson du rappeur Darell figure aussi dans une autre vidéo publiée sur YouTube le 9 novembre.\nLa mention de Snoop Dogg au début de la vidéo suspecte fait également référence à une actualité récente. Le 16 novembre, le rappeur américain a en effet annoncé arrêter de fumer. Il s'est par la suite avéré qu'il s'agissait d'une fausse annonce réalisée dans le cadre d'une opération publicitaire.\nCampagne de désinformation\nAucun élément ne soutient toutefois l'authenticité de la vidéo avec Volodymyr Zelensky. Il est possible d'altérer numériquement une vidéo afin d'y faire apparaître autre chose que l'image d'origine. Ce procédé a été utilisé par le passé pour diffuser de fausses informations au sujet du président ukrainien, également en modifiant des vidéos d'écrans géants à Times Square. De tels exemples ont été signalés par la dpa ici, ici et ici.\nQuant à la théorie selon laquelle Volodymyr Zelensky serait un consommateur de drogues, celle-ci revient régulièrement sur les réseaux sociaux. La dpa s'est également penchée sur de fausses affirmations de ce type ici et ici (en néerlandais).\n(Situation au 01.12.2023)",

An American company that has examined Tata, Annapurna, and many other branded salts sold in India under the name of iodized salts has given a shocking report. Potassium ferrocyanide X Link | Archive Link\nRating\nExplanation\nA newspaper cutting in English has gone viral on social media claiming that an American company has published a shocking report on iodized salts sold in India.\nIn reports, it’s said that “the use of branded packet salts containing the deadly poison Potassium Ferrocyanide can lead to life-threatening diseases such as hyperthyroidism, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, infertility, obesity, loss of kidney function. So buy only normal sea salt. It has mentioned that, use even less and save your health.”\nShocker..Alarming to know..\nPremium salt in India contains deadly cyanide,:US report\nReport reveals salt sold in India contain alarming levels of carcinogenic and harmful components like potassium ferrocyanide\nNowhere in the world potassium ferrocyanide is permitted for use.. pic.twitter.com/6Usq3uonqN — gopika (@krishnasdwar) October 16, 2019\nWhile analysing the viral claim post we also got more claims from the year 2019 that can be viewed here and here.\nWhat’s the truth?\nAfter analyzing the news that is circulating, we found that this is old rumour from 2019.\nGenerally, potassium ferrocyanide is used worldwide as an anti-caking agent. Its chemical formula is K4.3H20.\nThis involves a strong bond between the iron and cyanide ions. Meanwhile, potassium cyanide with the chemical name KCN has been identified as a potentially life-threatening toxin. Thus, potassium ferrocyanide is being mistaken for potassium cyanide by people.\nThe Hindu newspaper published an article about this in 2019. In general, LD50, also referred to as the “Lethal Dose 50%,” is the amount of chemical given to an animal to determine how much lethal the chemical that can cause that animal’s death, according to Dr. Sayam Sen Gupta, the inorganic chemist at IISER Kolkata.\nConsequently, adding sodium chloride at a rate of 3 g per kg of the rat’s body weight resulted in mortality. Therefore, 3 gm is the sodium chloride LD50 value. A similar study involving potassium ferrocyanide shows that the compound’s LD50 value was 3.6 gm. It was observed that this demonstrates unequivocally that potassium ferrocyanide’s LD50 value is comparable to ordinary salt.\nSimilarly, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has recommended levels of potassium ferrocyanide. Accordingly, the permissible level of potassium ferrocyanide in salt is 10 mg/kg. It is around 1.90 mg/kg in Tata salt and around 4.71 mg/kg in Sambhar salt. Dr Arvind Kumar, Principal Scientist, CSIR’s Central Saline and Marine Chemical Research Institute clarified that both these are permissible levels.\nThe World Health Organisation also just published a report titled “Global Report on Reducing Sodium Intake.” As a result, it has been stressed that everyone on the planet should cut back on their sodium consumption by 30% by the year 2025. Additionally, the report stated that Indians generally consume more than twice as much salt as the daily recommended allowance of 5 grams. There is also no mention of using potassium ferrocyanide in this report.\nWest American Analytical Laboratories published the initial report with this information. However, West American Analytical Laboratories’ director, Kyle F. Gross, denied in an email to Alt News in 2019 that he had examined or written about potassium ferrocyanide (PFC).\nThe widely shared post is critical of Indian-sold iodized salt. That being said, 167 million Indians are iodine deficient.\nConclusion:\nOur investigation revealed that the claims made by an American research institute regarding the potentially fatal illnesses caused by potassium ferrocyanide combined with salt that is sold in India are untrue.\nLinks\nhttps://www.fssai.gov.in/upload/media/FSSAI_News_False_Alt_23_07_2019.pdf\nhttps://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5374\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/fact-check-no-potassium-ferrocyanide-in-some-salt-brands-is-not-at-toxic-levels/article28263022.ece",
